# You need to count the number of prime numbers less than or equal to some natural n.
#
# For example:
# count_primes_less_than(34) = 11
# count_primes_less_than(69) = 19
# count_primes_less_than(420) = 81
# count_primes_less_than(666) = 121
# In this kata all the tests will be with 1 ⩽ � ⩽ 1 0 10 1⩽n⩽10 10
# Code length limited to 3000 characters to avoid hardcoding.
# Good luck!
