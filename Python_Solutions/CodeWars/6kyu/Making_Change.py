# Making Change
# Complete the method that will determine the minimum number of
# coins needed to make change for a given amount in American currency.
#
# Coins used will be half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies,
# worth 50¢, 25¢, 10¢, 5¢ and 1¢, respectively. They'll be represented by
# the symbols H, Q, D, N and P (symbols in Ruby, strings in in other languages)
#
# The argument passed in will be an integer representing the value in cents.
# The return value should be a hash/dictionary/object with the symbols as keys,
# and the numbers of coins as values. Coins that are not used should not be included
# in the hash. If the argument passed in is 0, then the method should return an empty hash.
#
# Examples
# make_change(0)   #-->  {}
# make_change(1)   #-->  {"P":1}
# make_change(43)  #-->  {"Q":1, "D":1, "N":1, "P":3}
# make_change(91)  #-->  {"H":1, "Q":1, "D":1, "N":1, "P":1}
