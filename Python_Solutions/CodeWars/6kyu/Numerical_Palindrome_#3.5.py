# A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which
# reads the same backward as forward. Examples of numerical palindromes are: 2332, 110011, 54322345
#
# For a given number num, write a function which returns an array of all the numerical
# palindromes contained within each number. The array should be sorted in ascending order
# and any duplicates should be removed.
#
# In this kata, single digit numbers and numbers which start or end with zeros (such as 010 and 00)
# are NOT considered valid numerical palindromes.
#
# If num contains no valid palindromes, return "No palindromes found". Otherwise, return "Not valid"
# if the input is not an integer or is less than 0.
#
# Examples
# palindrome(1221)      =>  [22, 1221]
# palindrome(34322122)  =>  [22, 212, 343, 22122]
# palindrome(1001331)   =>  [33, 1001, 1331]
# palindrome(1294)      =>  "No palindromes found"
# palindrome("1221")    =>  "Not valid"
