# A. Bachgold Problem
# time limit per test1 second
# memory limit per test256 megabytes
# Bachgold problem is very easy to formulate. Given a positive integer n represent it as a sum of maximum possible number of prime numbers. One can prove that such representation exists for any integer greater than 1.
#
# Recall that integer k is called prime if it is greater than 1 and has exactly two positive integer divisors — 1 and k.
#
# Input
# The only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000).
#
# Output
# The first line of the output contains a single integer k — maximum possible number of primes in representation.
#
# The second line should contain k primes with their sum equal to n. You can print them in any order. If there are several optimal solution, print any of them.
