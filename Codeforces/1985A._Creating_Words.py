# A. Creating Words
# time limit per test1 second
# memory limit per test256 megabytes
# Matthew is given two strings a
#  and b
# , both of length 3
# . He thinks it's particularly funny to create two new words by swapping the first character of a
#  with the first character of b
# . He wants you to output a
#  and b
#  after the swap.
#
# Note that the new words may not necessarily be different.
#
# Input
# The first line contains t
#  (1≤t≤100
# )  — the number of test cases.
#
# The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated strings, a
#  and b
# , both of length 3
# . The strings only contain lowercase Latin letters.
#
# Output
# For each test case, after the swap, output a
#  and b
# , separated by a space.
