# Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first n multiples of x.
#
# Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.
#
# Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).
#
# Examples
# count_by(1,10) #should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# count_by(2,5) #should return [2,4,6,8,10]
# ARRAYSFUNDAMENTALS
# Solution
def count_by(x, n):
    list = []
    for i in range(x, x * n + 1, x):
        list.append(i)
    return list
