# Ready! Set! Fire... but where should you fire?
#
# The battlefield is 3x3 wide grid. HQ has already provided you with an array for easier computing:
#
# grid = ['top left',    'top middle',    'top right',
#         'middle left', 'center',        'middle right',
#         'bottom left', 'bottom middle', 'bottom right']
# HQ radios you with 'x' and 'y' coordinates. x=0 y=0 being 'top left' part of the battlefield;
#
# Your duty is to create a function that takes those Xs and Ys and return the correct grid sector to be hit.
#
# fire(0,0) # 'top left'
# fire(1,2) # 'bottom middle'
# etc.
# Notice the grid is a monodimensional array, good luck!
