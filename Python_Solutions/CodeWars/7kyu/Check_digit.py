# In this Kata, you will be given a number, two indexes (index1 and index2) and a digit to look for. Your task will be to check if the digit exists in the number, within the indexes given.
#
# Be careful, the index2 is not necessarily more than the index1.
#
#   index1 == 2 and index2 == 5 -> snippet from 2 to 5 positons;
#   index1 == 5 and index2 == 2 -> snippet from 2 to 5 positons;
#
#   number.length = 14;
#
#   0 <= index1 < 14;
#
#   0 <= index2 < 14;
#
#   index2 is inclusive in search snippet;
#
#   0 <= digit <= 9;
