# The aim of the kata is to try to show how difficult it can be to calculate
# decimals of an irrational number with a certain precision. We have chosen to
# get a few decimals of the number "pi" using the following infinite series (Leibniz 1646â€“1716):
#
# PI / 4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... which gives an approximation of PI / 4.
#

#
# To have a measure of the difficulty we will count how many iterations are needed to calculate
# PI with a given precision of epsilon.
#
# There are several ways to determine the precision of the calculus but to keep things easy we will
# calculate PI within epsilon of your language Math::PI constant.
#
# In other words, given as input a precision of epsilon we will stop the iterative process when the
# absolute value of the difference between our calculation using the Leibniz series and the Math::PI
# constant of your language is less than epsilon.
#
# Your function returns an array or a string or a tuple depending on the language (See sample tests) with
#
# your number of iterations
# your approximation of PI with 10 decimals
# Example :
# Given epsilon = 0.001 your function gets an approximation of 3.140592653839794 for PI at the end of 1000
# iterations : since you are within epsilon of Math::PI you return
#
# iter_pi(0.001) --> [1000, 3.1405926538]
# Notes :
# Unfortunately, this series converges too slowly to be useful, as it takes over 300 terms to obtain a 2
# decimal place precision. To obtain 100 decimal places of PI, it was calculated that one would need to
# use at least 10^50 terms of this expansion!
