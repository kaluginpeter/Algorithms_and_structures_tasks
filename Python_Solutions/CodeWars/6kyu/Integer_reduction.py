# In this Kata, you will be given two integers n and k and your task is to
# remove k-digits from n and return the lowest number possible, without changing
# the order of the digits in n. Return the result as a string.
#
# Let's take an example of solve(123056,4). We need to remove 4 digits from 123056
# and return the lowest possible number. The best digits to remove are (1,2,3,6) so
# that the remaining digits are '05'. Therefore, solve(123056,4) = '05'.
#
# Note also that the order of the numbers in n does not change: solve(1284569,2) = '12456',
# because we have removed 8 and 9.
#
# More examples in the test cases.
#
# Good luck!
