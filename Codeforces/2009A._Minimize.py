# You are given two integers a
#  and b
#  (a≤b
# ). Over all possible integer values of c
#  (a≤c≤b
# ), find the minimum value of (c−a)+(b−c)
# .
#
# Input
# The first line contains t
#  (1≤t≤55
# ) — the number of test cases.
#
# Each test case contains two integers a
#  and b
#  (1≤a≤b≤10
# ).
#
# Output
# For each test case, output the minimum possible value of (c−a)+(b−c)
#  on a new line.

# Note
# In the first test case, you can choose c=1
#  and obtain an answer of (1−1)+(2−1)=1
# . It can be shown this is the minimum value possible.
#
# In the second test case, you can choose c=6
#  and obtain an answer of (6−3)+(10−6)=7
# . It can be shown this is the minimum value possible.
