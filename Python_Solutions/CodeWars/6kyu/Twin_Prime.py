# A twin prime is a prime number that differs from another prime number by 2. Write a function named is_twin_prime which takes an int parameter and returns true if it is a twin prime, else false.
#
# Examples
# given 5, which is prime
# 5 + 2 = 7, which is prime
# 5 - 2 = 3, which is prime
# hence, 5 has two prime twins and it is a Twin Prime.
# given 7, which is prime
# 7 - 2 = 5, which is prime
# 7 + 2 = 9. which is not prime
# hence, 7 has one prime twin, and it is a Twin Prime.
# given 9, which is not prime
# hence, 9 is not a Twin Prime
# given 953, which is prime
# 953 - 2 = 951, which is not prime
# 953 + 2 = 955, which is not prime
# hence, 953 is not a Twin Prime
