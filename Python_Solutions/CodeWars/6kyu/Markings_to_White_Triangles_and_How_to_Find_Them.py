# My tired eyes surveyed the horizon to spot a right triangle, made of an unknown material
# that sparkles in the endless void I have trekked thus far.
#
# I hurried towards it. However far it seemed, it can't compare to the uncounted days I have
# been trapped here in this endless void. To break the monotony, it shall do nicely.
#
# Reaching the triangle, I inspected it. It is even more spectacular up close than a far, like
# a piece of the heavens, just as grand as the best Hubble photo I've ever seen. Adorned onto its
# striking surface were two numbers, each hugging a side of the triangle in white chalk.
#
# {'a': 3, 'b': 4}
# Almost unconsciously, I grabbed at the misshapen chalk piece in my pocket, a small stone shaped
# calcium oddity I found among the void. I am hit with the sudden urge to write on the cosmic shape,
# to complete the numbers by filling in the missing side. The shear burning desire scares me, but I
# did it anyway. With a bit of internal head math, I wrote down my solution.
#
# {'a': 3, 'b': 4, 'c': 5}
# The triangle glowed white, contrasting almost blindingly against the surrounding darkness around me.
# Could it be, that solving this shape would be my salvation, my escape from this dark and empty place?
#
# I stared at the shining geometry for what felt like ever, before, with a disappointed sigh,
# I glanced away from the mesmerizing false hope. Only to catch the sight of two more triangles of right angles.
#
# {'a': 5, 'c': 13}
# {'b': 2, 'c': 3}
# Somehow, I knew the third triangle had its first side unmarked, rather than its second, I'll
# have to take that into account were I to do this right. I idly solved them both, looking on in
# wonder as they too turned white.
#
# {'a': 5, 'b': 12, 'c': 13}
# {'a': 2.236, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
# Something on the edge of my peripheral vision moved. I looked up, to be greeted with hundreds of
# right triangles, like angels from the heavens, coming down right at me.
#
# I might need a better solution to turn them all shining white...
