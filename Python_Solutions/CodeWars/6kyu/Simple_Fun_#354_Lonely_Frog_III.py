# Task
# You are a lonely frog.
#
# You live on a coordinate axis.
#
# The meaning of your life is to jump and jump..
#
# Two actions are allowed:
#
# forward: Move forward 1 unit.
#
# double: If you at x point, then you can move to x*2 point.
#
# Now, here comes your new task. Your starting point is x, the target point is y.
#
# You need to jump to the target point with minimal steps. Please tell me, what's the minimal steps?
#
# 1 <= x <= 10, x < y <= 100000
#
# Example
# For x = 1, y = 8, the output should be 3.
#
#  step  from   to      action
#   1:     1 --> 2     forward(or double)
#   2:     2 --> 4       double
#   3:     4 --> 8       double
# For x = 1, y = 17, the output should be 5.
#
#  step  from    to      action
#   1:     1  --> 2     forward(or double)
#   2:     2  --> 4       double
#   3:     4  --> 8       double
#   4:     8  --> 16      double
#   5:     16 --> 17     forward
# For x = 1, y = 15, the output should be 6.
#
#  step  from    to      action
#   1:     1  --> 2      forward(or double)
#   2:     2  --> 3      forward
#   3:     3  --> 6      double
#   5:     6  --> 7      forward
#   6:     7  --> 14     double
#   7:     14 --> 15     forward
# For x = 3, y = 12, the output should be 2.
#
#  step  from    to       action
#   1:     3  --> 6       double
#   2:     6  --> 12      double
# For x = 3, y = 16, the output should be 3.
#
#  step  from    to       action
#   1:     3  --> 4      forward
#   2:     4  --> 8       double
#   3:     8  --> 16      double
