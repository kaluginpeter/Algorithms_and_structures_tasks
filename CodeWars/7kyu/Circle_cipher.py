# Imagine a circle. To encode the word codewars, we could split the circle into 8 parts (as codewars has 8 letters):
#
# Then add the letters in a clockwise direction:Then remove the circle:
# If we read the result from left to right, we get csordaew.
#
# Decoding is the same process in reverse. If we decode csordaew, we get codewars.
#
# Examples:
# encode "codewars" -> "csordaew"
# decode "csordaew" -> "codewars"
# encode "white" -> "wehti"
# decode "wehti" -> "white"
