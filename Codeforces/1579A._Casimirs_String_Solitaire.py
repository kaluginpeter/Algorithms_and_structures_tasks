# A. Casimir's String Solitaire
# time limit per test2 seconds
# memory limit per test256 megabytes
# Casimir has a string s
#  which consists of capital Latin letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:
#
# he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent);
# or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent).
# Therefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2
# . All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.
#
# For example, with s
#  =
#  "ABCABC" he can obtain a string s
#  =
#  "ACBC" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.
#
# For a given string s
#  determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?
#
# Input
# The first line contains an integer t
#  (1≤t≤1000
# ) — the number of test cases.
#
# Each test case is described by one string s
# , for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s
#  consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1
#  to 50
#  letters, inclusive.
#
# Output
# Print t
#  lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.
#
# You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).
