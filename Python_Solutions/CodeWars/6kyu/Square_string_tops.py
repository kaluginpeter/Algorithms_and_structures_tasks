# Task
# Write a function that accepts msg string and returns local tops of string from the highest to the lowest.
# The string's tops are from displaying the string in the below way:
#
#
#                                          7891012
#                              TUWvXY      6     3
#                    ABCDE     S    Z      5
#            lmno    z   F     R    1      4
#      abc   k  p    v   G     Q    2      3
# .34..9 d...j  q....x   H.....P    3......2
# 125678 efghi  rstuwy   IJKLMNO    45678901
# The next top is always 1 character higher than the previous one. For the above example, the solution for the 123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuwyxvzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUWvXYZ123456789012345678910123 input string is 7891012TUWvXYABCDElmnoabc34.
#
# When the msg string is empty, return an empty string.
# The input strings may be very long. Make sure your solution has good performance.
# The (.)dots on the sample dispaly of string are only there to help you to understand the pattern
# Check the test cases for more samples.
