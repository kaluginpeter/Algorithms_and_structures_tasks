# Given an array of positive integers, replace every element with the least greater element to its right. If there is no greater element to its right, replace it with -1. For instance, given the array
#
# [8, 58, 71, 18, 31, 32, 63, 92, 43, 3, 91, 93, 25, 80, 28],
#
# the desired output is
#
# [18, 63, 80, 25, 32, 43, 80, 93, 80, 25, 93, -1, 28, -1, -1].
#
# Your task is to create a function that takes in an array as its argument, manipulates the array as described above, then return the resulting array.
#
# Note: Return a new array, rather than modifying the passed array.
