# A. Alternating Sum of Numbers
# time limit per test2 seconds
# memory limit per test256 megabytes
# You are given a sequence of integers. Output the alternating sum of this sequence. In other words, output a1−a2+a3−a4+a5−…
# . That is, the signs of plus and minus alternate, starting with a plus.
#
# Input
# The first line of the test contains one integer t
#  (1≤t≤1000
# ) — the number of test cases. Then follow t
#  test cases.
#
# The first line of each test case contains one integer n
#  (1≤n≤50
# ) — the length of the sequence. The second line of the test case contains n
#  integers a1,a2,…,an
#  (1≤ai≤100
# ).
#
# Output
# Output t
#  lines. For each test case, output the required alternating sum of the numbers.
