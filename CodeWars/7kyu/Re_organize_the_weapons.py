# The characters of Chima need your help. Their weapons got mixed up! They need you to write a program that accepts the name of a character in Chima then tells which weapon he/she owns.
#
# For example: for the character "Laval" your program should return the solution "Laval-Shado Valious"
#
# You must complete the following character-weapon pairs:
#
# Laval-Shado Valious,
# Cragger-Vengdualize,
# Lagravis-Blazeprowlor,
# Crominus-Grandorius,
# Tormak-Tygafyre,
# LiElla-Roarburn.
# Return "Not a character" for invalid inputs.
