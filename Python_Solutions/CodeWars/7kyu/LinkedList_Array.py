# Linked lists are data structures composed of nested or chained objects, each containing a single value and a reference to the next object.
#
# Here's an example of a list:
#
# class LinkedList:
#     def __init__(self, value=0, next=None):
#         self.value = value
#         self.next = next
#
# LinkedList(1, LinkedList(2, LinkedList(3)))
# Write a function listToArray (or list_to_array in Python) that converts a list to an array, like this:
#
# [1, 2, 3]
# Assume all inputs are valid lists with at least one value. For the purpose of simplicity, all values will be either numbers, strings, or Booleans.
