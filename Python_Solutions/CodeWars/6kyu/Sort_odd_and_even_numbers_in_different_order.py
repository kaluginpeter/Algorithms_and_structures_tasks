# You are given an array of integers. Your task is to sort odd numbers within the array in ascending order, and even numbers in descending order.
#
# Note that zero is an even number. If you have an empty array, you need to return it.
#
# For example:
#
# [5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 4]  -->  [1, 3, 8, 4, 5, 2]
#
# odd numbers ascending:   [1, 3,       5   ]
# even numbers descending: [      8, 4,    2]
