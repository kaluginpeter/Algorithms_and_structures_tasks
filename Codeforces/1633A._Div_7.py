# A. Div. 7

# You are given an integer n
# . You have to change the minimum number of digits in it in such a way that the resulting number does not have any leading zeroes and is divisible by 7
# .
#
# If there are multiple ways to do it, print any of them. If the given number is already divisible by 7
# , leave it unchanged.
#
# Input
# The first line contains one integer t
#  (1≤t≤990
# ) — the number of test cases.
#
# Then the test cases follow, each test case consists of one line containing one integer n
#  (10≤n≤999
# ).
#
# Output
# For each test case, print one integer without any leading zeroes — the result of your changes (i. e. the integer that is divisible by 7
#  and can be obtained by changing the minimum possible number of digits in n
# ).
#
# If there are multiple ways to apply changes, print any resulting number. If the given number is already divisible by 7
# , just print it.

# 3
# 42
# 23
# 377
# OutputCopy
# 42
# 28
# 777
# Note
# In the first test case of the example, 42
#  is already divisible by 7
# , so there's no need to change it.
#
# In the second test case of the example, there are multiple answers — 28
# , 21
#  or 63
# .
#
# In the third test case of the example, other possible answers are 357
# , 371
#  and 378
# . Note that you cannot print 077
#  or 77
# .
