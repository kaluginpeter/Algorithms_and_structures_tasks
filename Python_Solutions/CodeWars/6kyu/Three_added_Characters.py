# Given two strings, the first being a random string and the second being the same as the first, but with three added characters somewhere in the string (three same characters),
#
# Write a function that returns the added character
#
# E.g
# string1 = "hello"
# string2 = "aaahello"
#
# // => 'a'
# The above is just an example; the characters could be anywhere in the string and string2 is actually shuffled.
#
# Another example
# string1 = "abcde"
# string2 = "2db2a2ec"
#
# // => '2'
# Note that the added character could also exist in the original string
#
# string1 = "aabbcc"
# string2 = "aacccbbcc"
#
# // => 'c'
# You can assume that string2 will aways be larger than string1, and there will always be three added characters in string2.
