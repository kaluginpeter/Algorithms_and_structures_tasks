# It seemed a good idea at the time...
#
# Why I did it?
# After a year on Codewars I really needed a holiday...
#
# But not wanting to drift backwards in the honour rankings while I was away, I hatched a cunning plan!
#
# The Cunning Plan
# So I borrowed my friend's "Clone Machine" and cloned myself :-)
#
# Now my clone can do my Kata solutions for me and I can relax!
#
# Brilliant!!
#
# Furthermore, at the end of the day my clone can re-clone herself...
#
# Double brilliant!!
#
# I wonder why I didn't think to do this earlier?
#
# So as I left for the airport I gave my clone instructions to:
#
# do my Kata solutions for me
# feed the cat
# try to keep the house tidy and not eat too much
# sleep
# clone yourself
# repeat same next day
# The Flaw
# Well, how was I supposed to know that cloned DNA is faulty?
#
# :-(
#
# Every time they sleep they wake up with decreased ability - they get slower... they get dumber... they are only able to solve 1 less Kata than they could the previous day.
#
# For example, if they can solve 10 Kata today, then tomorrow they can solve only 9 Kata, then 8, 7, 6... Eventually they can't do much more than sit around all day playing video games.
#
# And (unlike me), when the clone cannot solve any more Kata they are no longer clever enough to operate the clone machine either!
#
# The Return Home
# I suspected something was wrong when I noticed my Codewars honour had stopped rising.
#
# I made a hasty return home...
#
# ...and found 100s of clones scattered through the house. Mostly they sit harmlessly mumbling to themselves. The largest group have made a kind of nest in my loungeroom where they sit catatonic in front of the PlayStation.
#
# The whole place needs fumigating.
#
# The fridge and pantry are empty.
#
# And I can't find the cat.
#
# Kata Task
# Write a method to predict the final outcome where:
#
# Input:
#
# kata-per-day is the number of Kata I can solve per day
# Output:
#
# [number-of-clones, number-of-kata-solved-by-clones]
# Algorithms
# Solution

        solved += robots * (kata_per_day - i - 1)
