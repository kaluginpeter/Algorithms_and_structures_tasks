# ##Task: You have to write a function add which takes two binary numbers as strings and returns their sum as a string.
#
# ##Note:
#
# You are not allowed to convert binary to decimal & vice versa.
# The sum should contain No leading zeroes.
# ##Examples:
#
# add('111','10'); => '1001'
# add('1101','101'); => '10010'
# add('1101','10111') => '100100'
