# Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common factor is 1; in other words: if they cannot be divided by any other common numbers than 1.
#
# 13, 16, 9, 5, and 119 are all relatively prime because they share no common factors, except for 1. To see this, I will show their factorizations:
#
#  13: 13
#  16: 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
#   9: 3 * 3
#   5: 5
# 119: 17 * 7
# Complete the function that takes 2 arguments: a number (n), and a list of numbers (arr). The function should return a list of all the numbers in arr that are relatively prime to n. All numbers in will be positive integers.

# relatively_prime(15, [72, 27, 32, 61, 77, 11, 40])
