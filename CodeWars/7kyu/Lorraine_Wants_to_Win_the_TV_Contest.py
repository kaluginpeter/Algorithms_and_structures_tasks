# There are many word games that can help to make our minds more agile. Many TV programs, in different countries, use them as entertainment for the audience.
#
# Lorraine had tried to win one of them many times but she was not successful in her attempts. The TV contest is as follows:
#
# The TV show host gives a random caller a scrambled word (that is incomprehensible) and by rearranging those letters they have to discover a word that is in the Oxford English Dictionary.
#
# They have only 25 seconds to discover the word.
#
# Her friend Bruce obtained the list of 2000, frequently used, English words used by the TV show.
#
# Help Lorraine by making a function that will give her a list of all valid words that may be obtained by rearranging the scrambled word. There always be at least one valid word for each test case.
#
# Let's see some test cases:
#
# unscramble("shi") == ['his']
#
# unscramble("nowk") == ['know']
#
# unscramble("amle") == ['male', 'meal']
# The list of words that Bruce obtained (keep the secret!) is named word_list, in ruby $word_list and javascript wordList. For words with more than six letters we have a challenge with speed. Try to create a suitable memoized data structure for fast hashing using the provided word_list.
#
# Remember that all the words will correspond to U.K. English (Oxford Dictionary).
