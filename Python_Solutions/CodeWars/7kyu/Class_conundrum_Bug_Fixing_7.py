# Class conundrum - Bug Fixing #7
# Oh no! Timmy's List Class has broken! Can you help timmy and fix his class? Timmy has a List class he has created, this is used for type strict arrays (which timmy calls Lists).
#
# When timmy calls the Count property of the list it still remains at 0 when adding items.
#
# Also it fails when timmy trys to chain the adds e.g.
#
# my_list.add(0).add(1)
