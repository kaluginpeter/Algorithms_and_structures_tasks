# Every book has n pages with page numbers 1 to n.
# The summary is made by adding up the number of digits of all page numbers.
#
# Task: Given the summary, find the number of pages n the book has.
#
# Example
# If the input is summary=25, then the output must be n=17:
# The numbers 1 to 17 have 25 digits in total: 1234567891011121314151617.
#
# Be aware that you'll get enormous books having up to 100.000 pages.
#
# All inputs will be valid.
