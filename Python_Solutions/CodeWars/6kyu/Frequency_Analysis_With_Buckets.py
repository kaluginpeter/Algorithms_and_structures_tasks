# Description:
#
# Given an input array (arr) of positive integers, the objective is to return an output array where each index
# represents the amount of times an element appeared (frequency) in the input array.
#
# More specifically, the element at each index of the output array will be an array (bucket) containing integers
# that appeared index-amount-of-times.
#
# Otherwise, slot nulls (JavaScript, Java), None's (Python) nils (Ruby), or NULL's (C/C++) where appropriate.
# A valid array will always be provided.
#
# If an array of [1,2,3,4,4,5,5,5] is passed in, the expected output should be: [null, [1,2,3], [4], [5], null,
# null, null, null, null].
#
# Explanation:
#
# # bucketize(arr) ======> outputArray
# bucketize(1,2,3,4,4,5,5,5) ======> [None, [1, 2, 3], [4], [5], None, None, None, None, None]
# An element cannot appear 0 times, so a null is placed at outputArray[0]. The elements 1, 2, and 3 appear
# once. This is why they are located at outputArray[1]. Notice the elements are grouped together in an array
# and sorted in ascending order. The element 4 appears twice. This is why it is located at outputArray[2].
# The element 5 appears three times. This is why it is located at outputArray[3].
#
# Although an integer could have possibly appeared four, five, six, seven, or eight times,
# this is not the case for this particular example. This is the reason why the elements at outputArray[4],
# outputArray[5], outputArray[6], outputArray[7], and outputArray[8] are all null values.
#
# Examples:
#
# bucketize(2,2,4,4,6,6,9,9,9,9) ==> [None, None, [2,4,6], None, [9], None, None, None, None, None, None]
# bucketize(3,3,3,3,2) ============> [None, [2], None, None, [3], None]
# bucketize(5,5,5,5,5) ============> [None, None, None, None, None, [5]]
# bucketize(77,3,40,40,40) ========> [None, [3,77], None, [40], None, None]
# bucketize(16,7,5,3,6,23) ========> [None, [3,5,6,7,16,23], None, None, None, None, None]
