# Task
# Your challenge is to write a function named getSlope/get_slope/GetSlope that calculates the slope of the line through two points.
#
# Input
# Each point that the function takes in is an array 2 elements long. The first number is the x coordinate and the second number is the y coordinate. If the line through the two points is vertical or if the same point is given twice, the function should return null/None.
