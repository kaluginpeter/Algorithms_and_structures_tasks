# Write a function that will check whether ANY permutation of the characters
# of the input string is a palindrome. Bonus points for a solution that is efficient
# and/or that uses only built-in language functions. Deem yourself brilliant if you
# can come up with a version that does not use any function whatsoever.
#
# For this kata assume that all characters are lowercase.
#
# Example
# madam -> True
# adamm -> True
# junk -> False
#
# Hint
# The brute force approach would be to generate all the permutations
# of the string and check each one of them whether it is a palindrome.
# However, an optimized approach will not require this at all.
