# Write a function that returns the number of '2's in the factorization of a number.
# For example,
#
# two_count(24)
# should return 3, since the factorization of 24 is 2^3 x 3
#
# two_count(17280)
# should return 7, since the factorization of 17280 is 2^7 x 5 x 3^3
# The number passed to two_count (twoCount) will always be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
