# Task:
# Write a function get_honor which accepts a username from someone at Codewars and returns an integer containing the user's honor. If input is invalid, raise an error.
#
# If you want/don't want your username to be in the tests, ask me in the discourse area. There can't be too many though because the server may time out.
# Example¹:
# >>> get_honor('dpleshkov')
# 4418
# >>> get_honor('jhoffner')
# 21949
# ¹ Honor may or may not be current to the user
#
# Libraries/Recommendations:
# Fsharp:
# open System.Net: use this namespace for opening a webpage(It's just a suggestion).
# open System.Text.RegularExpressions: this namepsace will give you access to Regex.
# Python:
# urllib.request.urlopen: Opens up a webpage.
# re: The RegEx library for Python.
# bs4(BeautifulSoup): A tool for scraping HTML and XML.
# Notes:
# Time out / server errors often happen with the test cases depending on the status of the codewars website. Try submitting your code a few times or at different hours of the day if needed.
# Feel free to voice your comments and concerns in the discourse area.
# There is no example tests. Sorry, the honor may vary from time to time. I apologize for the inconvenience.
