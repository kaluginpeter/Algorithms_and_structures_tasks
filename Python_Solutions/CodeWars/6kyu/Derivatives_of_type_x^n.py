# You are provided with a function of the form f(x) = axⁿ,
# that consists of a single term only and 'a' and 'n' are integers, e.g f(x) = 3x², f(x) = 5 etc.
#
# Your task is to create a function that takes f(x) as the argument and returns
# the result of differentiating the function, that is, the derivative.

# Input is a string, for example "5x^4". The function f(x) consists of a single term only. Variable is denoted by x.
# Output should be a string, for example "20x^3".
#
# Examples
# "3x^2"  => "6x"
# "-5x^3" => "-15x^2"
# "6x^-2" => "-12x^-3"
# "5x"    => "5"
# "-x"    => "-1"
# "42"    => "0"
