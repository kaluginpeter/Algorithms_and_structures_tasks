# Hey awesome programmer!
#
# You've got much data to manage and of course you use zero-based and non-negative ID's to make each data item unique!
#
# Therefore you need a method, which returns the smallest unused ID for your next new data item...
#
# Note: The given array of used IDs may be unsorted. For test reasons there may be duplicate IDs, but you don't have to find or remove them!
#
# Go on and code some pure awesomeness!

def next_id(arr):
    arr = set(arr)
    t = 0
    while t in arr:
        t += 1
    return t
