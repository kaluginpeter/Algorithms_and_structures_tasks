# Something is wrong with our Warrior class. All variables should initialize properly and the attack method is not working as expected.
#
# If properly set, it should correctly calculate the damage after an attack (if the attacker position is == to the block position of the defender: no damage; otherwise, the defender gets 10 damage if hit "high" or 5 damage if hit "low". If no block is set, the defender takes 5 extra damage.
#
# For some reason, the health value is not being properly set. The following shows an example of this code being used:
#
# ninja = Warrior('Hanzo Hattori')
# samurai = Warrior('Ry≈çma Sakamoto')
#
# samurai.block = 'l'
# ninja.attack(samurai, 'h')
# # samurai.health should be 90 now
# The warrios must be able to fight to the bitter end, and good luck to the most skilled!
#
# Notice that health can't be below 0: once hit to 0 health, a warrior attribute deceased becomes true; if hit again, the zombie attribute becomes true too!
#
# DEBUGGING
# Solution
Position = {'high': 'h', 'low': 'l'}  # don't change this!
