# Given an Array and an Example-Array to sort to, write a function that sorts the Array following the Example-Array.
#
# Assume Example Array catalogs all elements possibly seen in the input Array. However, the input Array does not necessarily have to have all elements seen in the Example.
#
# Example:
#
# Arr: [1,3,4,4,4,4,5]
#
# Example Arr: [4,1,2,3,5]
#
# Result: [4,4,4,4,1,3,5]
