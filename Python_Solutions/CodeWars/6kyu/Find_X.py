# Part 2 version Find X â…¡
#
# We have a function that takes in an integer n, and returns a number x.
#
# Lets call this function findX(n)/find_x(n) (depending on your language):
#
# def find_x(n):
#     x = 0
#     for i in range(n):
#         for j in range(2*n):
#             x += j + i
#     return x
# The functions loops throught the number n and at every iteration, performs a nested loop on 2*n, at each iteration of this nested loop it increments x with the (nested loop index + parents loop index).
#
# This works well when the numbers are reasonably small.
#
# find_x(2) #=> 16
# find_x(3) #=> 63
# find_x(5) #=> 325
# But may be slow for numbers > 103
#
# So your task is to optimize the function findX/find_x, so it works well for large numbers.
#
# Input Range
# 1 <= n <= 106 (105 in JS)
#
# Note: This problem is more about logical reasoning than it is about finding a mathematicial formula, infact there are no complex math formula involved

# Solution
def find_x(n):
    y = n * (2*n-1)
    return (n * (y + (n-1) * (2*n) + y)) // 2
