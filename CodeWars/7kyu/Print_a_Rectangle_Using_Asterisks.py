# Write a method that, given two arguments, width and height, returns a string representing a rectangle with those dimensions.
#
# The rectangle should be filled with spaces, and its borders should be composed of asterisks (*).
#
# For example, given width = 3 and height = 3:
#
# ***
# * *
# ***
# End each line of the string (including the last one) with a carriage return-line feed combination.
#
# Note: You may assume that width and height will always be greater than zero.
