# Given an integer n, we can construct a new integer with the following procedure:
#
# For each digit d in n, find the dth prime number. (If d=0, use 1)
# Take the product of these prime numbers. This is our new integer.
# For example, take 25: The 2nd prime is 3, and the 5th is 11. So 25 would evaluate to 3*11 = 33.
#
# If we iterate this procedure, we generate a sequence of integers.
#
# Write a function that, given a positive integer n, returns the maximum value in the sequence starting at n.
#
# Example: 8 -> 19 -> 46 -> 91 -> 46 -> 91 -> ...
# So the maximum here would be 91.
# 0 <= n <= 10^12
