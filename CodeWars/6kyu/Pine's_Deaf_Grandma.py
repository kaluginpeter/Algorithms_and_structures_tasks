# Pine's grandma is hearing impaired: whatever you say to her, she responds with "HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!", unless you shout it (type in all capitals).
#
# If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back, "NO, NOT SINCE 1938!" You can't stop talking to grandma until you shout "BYE".
#
# When you shout "BYE", grandma shouts back "OK, BYE!" and end the conversation.
#
# Your input is an array with a list of strings with all the words/sentences you say in order
# You can expect there is aways a "BYE", although it is not necessarily the last word in the list
# Your output is an array with a list of strings and every sentence Pine's grandma replies
# Words/sentences are always a string
# Example
# ["hi grandma", "WHAT", "bye", "BYE"]  -->
# ["HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!", "NO, NOT SINCE 1938!", "HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!", "OK, BYE!"]
