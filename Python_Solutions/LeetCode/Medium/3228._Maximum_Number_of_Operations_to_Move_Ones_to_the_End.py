# You are given a
# binary string
#  s.
#
# You can perform the following operation on the string any number of times:
#
# Choose any index i from the string where i + 1 < s.length such that s[i] == '1' and s[i + 1] == '0'.
# Move the character s[i] to the right until it reaches the end of the string or another '1'. For example, for s = "010010", if we choose i = 1, the resulting string will be s = "000110".
# Return the maximum number of operations that you can perform.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: s = "1001101"
#
# Output: 4
#
# Explanation:
#
# We can perform the following operations:
#
# Choose index i = 0. The resulting string is s = "0011101".
# Choose index i = 4. The resulting string is s = "0011011".
# Choose index i = 3. The resulting string is s = "0010111".
# Choose index i = 2. The resulting string is s = "0001111".
# Example 2:
#
# Input: s = "00111"
#
# Output: 0
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 105
# s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
# General idea:
# Calculate how many ones you have staring from 0 index to end of string.
# Id current char is "1" - increment ones
# At each iteration mark boolean "move" variable to False
# If you need move to next '1' character, mark boolean "move" variable on True
# If "move" variable is True - add count of ones to total score
# Complexity
# Time complexity: O(N)
# Space complexity: O(1)
# Code
