# C. K-th Not Divisible by n
# time limit per test1 second
# memory limit per test256 megabytes
# You are given two positive integers n
#  and k
# . Print the k
# -th positive integer that is not divisible by n
# .
#
# For example, if n=3
# , and k=7
# , then all numbers that are not divisible by 3
#  are: 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,13…
# . The 7
# -th number among them is 10
# .
#
# Input
# The first line contains an integer t
#  (1≤t≤1000
# ) — the number of test cases in the input. Next, t
#  test cases are given, one per line.
#
# Each test case is two positive integers n
#  (2≤n≤109
# ) and k
#  (1≤k≤109
# ).
#
# Output
# For each test case print the k
# -th positive integer that is not divisible by n
# .
