# Kata Task
# Given 3 points a, b, c
#
#             c
#
#                      b
#   a
#
# Find the shortest distance from point c to a straight line that passes through points a and b
#
# Notes
#
# all points are of the form [x,y] where x >= 0 and y >= 0
# if a and b are the same then just return distance between a and c
# use Euclidean distance
