# Find the longest substring within a string that contains at most 2 unique characters.
#
# substring("a") => "a"
# substring("aaa") => "aaa"
# substring("abacd") => "aba"
# substring("abacddcd") => "cddcd"
# substring("cefageaacceaccacca") => "accacca"
# This function will take alphanumeric characters as input.
#
# In cases where there could be more than one correct answer, the first string
# occurrence should be used. For example, substring('abc') should return 'ab' instead of 'bc'.
#
# Although there are O(N^2) solutions to this problem, you should try to solve
# this problem in O(N) time. Tests may pass for O(N^2) solutions but, this is not guaranteed.
#
# This question is much harder than some of the other substring questions.
# It's easy to think that you have a solution and then get hung up on the implementation.
