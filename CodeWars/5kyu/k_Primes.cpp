/*
A natural number is called k-prime if it has exactly k prime factors, counted with multiplicity. For example:

k = 2  -->  4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, ...
k = 3  -->  8, 12, 18, 20, 27, 28, 30, ...
k = 5  -->  32, 48, 72, 80, 108, 112, ...
A natural number is thus prime if and only if it is 1-prime.

Task:
Complete the function count_Kprimes (or countKprimes, count-K-primes, kPrimes) which is given parameters k, start, end (or nd) and returns an array (or a list or a string depending on the language - see "Solution" and "Sample Tests") of the k-primes between start (inclusive) and end (inclusive).

Example:
countKprimes(5, 500, 600) --> [500, 520, 552, 567, 588, 592, 594]
Notes:

The first function would have been better named: findKprimes or kPrimes :-)
In C some helper functions are given (see declarations in 'Solution').
For Go: nil slice is expected when there are no k-primes between start and end.
Second Task: puzzle (not for Shell)
Given a positive integer s, find the total number of solutions of the equation a + b + c = s, where a is 1-prime, b is 3-prime, and c is 7-prime.

Call this function puzzle(s).

Examples:
puzzle(138)  -->  1  because [2 + 8 + 128] is the only solution
puzzle(143)  -->  2  because [3 + 12 + 128] and [7 + 8 + 128] are the solutions
