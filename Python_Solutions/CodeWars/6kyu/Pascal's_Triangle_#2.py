# Here you will create the classic Pascal's triangle.
# Your function will be passed the depth of the triangle and your code has
# to return the corresponding Pascal's triangle up to that depth.
#
# The triangle should be returned as a nested array. For example:
#
# pascal(5) -> [ [1], [1,1], [1,2,1], [1,3,3,1], [1,4,6,4,1] ]
# To build the triangle, start with a single 1 at the top, for each number in
# the next row you just take the two numbers above it and add them
# together, except for the edges, which are all 1. e.g.:
#
#       1
#     1   1
#   1   2   1
# 1   3   3   1
