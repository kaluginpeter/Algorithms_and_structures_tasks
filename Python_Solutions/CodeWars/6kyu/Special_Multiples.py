# Some numbers have the property to be divisible by 2 and 3. Other smaller subset of numbers have the property to be divisible by 2, 3 and 5. Another subset with less abundant numbers may be divisible by 2, 3, 5 and 7. These numbers have something in common: their prime factors are contiguous primes.
#
# Implement a function that finds the amount of numbers that have the first N primes as factors below a given limit.
#
# Let's see some cases:
#
# count_specMult(3, 200)  =>  6
#
# The first 3 primes are: 2, 3 and 5.
#
# And the found numbers below 200 are: 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180.
# Happy coding!!
