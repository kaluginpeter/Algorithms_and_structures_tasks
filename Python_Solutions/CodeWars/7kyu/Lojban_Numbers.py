# Lojban Numbers
# Counting in Lojban, an artificial language developed over the last forty years, is easier than in most languages. The numbers from zero to nine are:
#
# 1 pa 4 vo 7 ze
# 2 re 5 mu 8 bi 0 no
# 3 ci 6 xa 9 so
# Larger numbers are created by gluing the digits together. For example, 123 is pareci.
#
# Write a program that reads in a Lojban string (representing a number less than or equal to 1,000,000) and outputs it in numbers.
#
# Example:
# renonore  # Lojban string
# 2002  # Number
# Input/Output
# [input] string representing the number in Lojban pareci
# Constraints: Lojban number â‰¤ 1,000,000
# [output] integer representing the Lojban number 123
