# Your task is to write a function named do_math that receives a single argument.
# This argument is a string that contains multiple whitespace delimited numbers.
# Each number has a single alphabet letter somewhere within it.
#
# Example : "24z6 1x23 y369 89a 900b"
# As shown above, this alphabet letter can appear anywhere within the number.
# You have to extract the letters and sort the numbers according to their corresponding letters.
#
# Example : "24z6 1x23 y369 89a 900b" will become 89 900 123 369 246 (ordered according to the alphabet letter)
# Here comes the difficult part, now you have to do a series of computations on the numbers you have extracted.
#
# The sequence of computations are + - * /. Basic math rules do NOT apply, you have to do each computation
# in exactly this order.
# This has to work for any size of numbers sent in (after division, go back to addition, etc).
# In the case of duplicate alphabet letters, you have to arrange them according to the number that appeared
# first in the input string.
# Remember to also round the final answer to the nearest integer.
# Examples :
# "24z6 1x23 y369 89a 900b" = 89 + 900 - 123 * 369 / 246 = 1299
# "24z6 1z23 y369 89z 900b" = 900 + 369 - 246 * 123 / 89 = 1414
# "10a 90x 14b 78u 45a 7b 34y" = 10 + 45 - 14 * 7 / 78 + 90 - 34 = 60
# Good luck and may the CODE be with you!
