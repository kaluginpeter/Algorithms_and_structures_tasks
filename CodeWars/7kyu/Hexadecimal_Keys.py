# Hector the hacker has stolen some information, but it is encrypted. In order to decrypt it, he needs to write a function that will generate a decryption key from the encryption key which he stole (it is in hexadecimal). To do this, he has to determine the two prime factors P and Q of the encyption key, and return the product (P-1) * (Q-1).
#
# Note: the primes used are < 105
#
# Examples
# For example if the encryption key is "47b", it is 1147 in decimal. This factors to 31*37, so the key Hector needs is 1080 (= 30*36).
#
# More examples:
#
# input: "2533", result: 9328 (primes: 89, 107)
# input: "1ba9", result: 6912 (primes: 73, 97)
