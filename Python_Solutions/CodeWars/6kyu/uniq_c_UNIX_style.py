# Implement a function which behaves like the 'uniq -c' command in UNIX.
#
# It takes as input a sequence and returns a sequence in which all duplicate elements following each other have been reduced to one instance together with the number of times a duplicate elements occurred in the original array.
#
# Example:
# ['a','a','b','b','c','a','b','c'] --> [('a',2),('b',2),('c',1),('a',1),('b',1),('c',1)]
