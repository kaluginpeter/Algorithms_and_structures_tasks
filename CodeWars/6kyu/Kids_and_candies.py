# I've invited some kids for my son's birthday, during which I will give to each kid some amount of candies.
#
# Every kid hates receiving less amount of candies than any other kids, and I don't want to have any candies left - giving it to my kid would be bad for his teeth.
#
# However, not every kid invited will come to my birthday party.
#
# What is the minimum amount of candies I have to buy, so that no matter how many kids come to the party in the end, I can still ensure that each kid can receive the same amount of candies, while leaving no candies left?
#
# It's ensured that at least one kid will participate in the party.
