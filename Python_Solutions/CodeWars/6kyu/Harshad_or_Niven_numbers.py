# Harshad numbers (also called Niven numbers) are positive numbers that can be
# divided (without remainder) by the sum of their digits.
#
# For example, the following numbers are Harshad numbers:
#
# 10, because 1 + 0 = 1 and 10 is divisible by 1
# 27, because 2 + 7 = 9 and 27 is divisible by 9
# 588, because 5 + 8 + 8 = 21 and 588 is divisible by 21
# While these numbers are not:
#
# 19, because 1 + 9 = 10 and 19 is not divisible by 10
# 589, because 5 + 8 + 9 = 22 and 589 is not divisible by 22
# 1001, because 1 + 1 = 2 and 1001 is not divisible by 2
# Harshad numbers can be found in any number base, but we are going to focus on base 10 exclusively.
#
# Your task
# Your task is to complete the skeleton Harshad object ("static class") which has 3 functions:
#
# isValid() that checks if n is a Harshad number or not
# getNext() that returns the next Harshad number > n
# getSerie() that returns a series of n Harshad numbers, optional start value not included
# You do not need to care about the passed parameters in the test cases,
# they will always be valid integers (except for the start argument in
# getSerie() which is optional and should default to 0).
#
# Note: only the first 2000 Harshad numbers will be checked in the tests.
#
# Examples
# Harshad.is_valid(1)          ==>  True
# Harshad.get_next(0)          ==>  1
# Harshad.get_series(3)        ==>  [ 1, 2, 3 ]
# Harshad.get_series(3, 1000)  ==>  [ 1002, 1008, 1010 ]
# FUNDAMENTALSMATHEMATICS
# Solution
