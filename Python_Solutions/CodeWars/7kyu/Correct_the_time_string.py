# A new task for you!
#
# You have to create a method, that corrects a given time string.
# There was a problem in addition, so many of the time strings are broken.
# Time is formatted using the 24-hour clock, so from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59.
# Examples
# "09:10:01" -> "09:10:01"
# "11:70:10" -> "12:10:10"
# "19:99:99" -> "20:40:39"
# "24:01:01" -> "00:01:01"
# If the input-string is null or empty return exactly this value! (empty string for C++) If the time-string-format is invalid, return null. (empty string for C++)
#
# Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)
#
# I have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.
