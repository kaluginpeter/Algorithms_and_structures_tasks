# Write a function that takes an arbitrary number of strings and interlaces them
# (combines them by alternating characters from each string).
#
# For example combineStrings('abc', '123') should return 'a1b2c3'.
#
# If the strings are different lengths the function should interlace them
# until each string runs out, continuing to add characters from the remaining strings.
#
# For example combineStrings('abcd', '123') should return 'a1b2c3d'.
#
# The function should take any number of arguments and combine them.
#
# For example combineStrings('abc', '123', '£$%') should return 'a1£b2$c3%'.
#
# Note: if only one argument is passed return only that string. If no arguments are passed return an empty string.
