# A. Potion-making

# You have an initially empty cauldron, and you want to brew a potion in it. The potion consists of two ingredients: magic essence and water. The potion you want to brew should contain exactly k %
#  magic essence and (100−k) %
#  water.
#
# In one step, you can pour either one liter of magic essence or one liter of water into the cauldron. What is the minimum number of steps to brew a potion? You don't care about the total volume of the potion, only about the ratio between magic essence and water in it.
#
# A small reminder: if you pour e
#  liters of essence and w
#  liters of water (e+w>0
# ) into the cauldron, then it contains ee+w⋅100 %
#  (without rounding) magic essence and we+w⋅100 %
#  water.
#
# Input
# The first line contains the single t
#  (1≤t≤100
# ) — the number of test cases.
#
# The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer k
#  (1≤k≤100
# ) — the percentage of essence in a good potion.
#
# Output
# For each test case, print the minimum number of steps to brew a good potion. It can be proved that it's always possible to achieve it in a finite number of steps.

# Note
# In the first test case, you should pour 3
#  liters of magic essence and 97
#  liters of water into the cauldron to get a potion with 3 %
#  of magic essence.
#
# In the second test case, you can pour only 1
#  liter of essence to get a potion with 100 %
#  of magic essence.
#
# In the third test case, you can pour 1
#  liter of magic essence and 3
#  liters of water.
