# The look and say sequence is a sequence in which each number is
# the result of a "look and say" operation on the previous element.
#
# Considering for example the classical version startin with "1":
# ["1", "11", "21, "1211", "111221", ...]. You can see that the second
# element describes the first as "1(times number)1", the third is "2(times number)1"
# describing the second, the fourth is "1(times number)2(and)1(times number)1" and so on.
#
# Your goal is to create a function which takes a starting string (not necessarily the classical "1",
# much less a single character start) and return the nth element of the series.
#
# Examples
# look_and_say_sequence("1", 1)   == "1"
# look_and_say_sequence("1", 3)   == "21"
# look_and_say_sequence("1", 5)   == "111221"
# look_and_say_sequence("22", 10) == "22"
# look_and_say_sequence("14", 2)  == "1114"
# Trivia: "22" is the only element that can keep the series constant.
