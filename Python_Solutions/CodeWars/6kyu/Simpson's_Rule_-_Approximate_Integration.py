# We want to try Simpson's rule with the function f:
#
# �
# (
# �
# )
# =
# 3
# 2
# sin
# ⁡
# (
# �
# )

# f(x)=

# 3
# ​
#  sin(x)

#
# The task is to write a function called simpson with parameter n which returns the value of the integral of f on the interval [0, pi] (pi being 3.14159265359...).
#
# Notes:
# Don't round or truncate your results. See in "RUN EXAMPLES" the function assertFuzzyEquals or testing.
# n will always be even.
# We know that the exact value of the integral of f on the given interval is 2.
