# You've got a bunch of textual data with embedded phone numbers. Write a function area_code() that finds and returns just the area code portion of the phone number.

# >>> message = "The supplier's phone number is (555) 867-5309"
# >>> area_code(message)
# '555'
# The returned area code should be a string, not a number. Every phone number is formatted like in the example, and the only non-alphanumeric characters in the string are apostrophes ' or the punctuation used in the phone number.
