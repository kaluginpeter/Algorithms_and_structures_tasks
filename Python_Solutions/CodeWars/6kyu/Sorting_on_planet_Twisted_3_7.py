#Sorting on planet Twisted-3-7
#
# There is a planet... in a galaxy far far away. It is exactly like our planet, but it has one difference: #The values of the digits 3 and 7 are twisted. Our 3 means 7 on the planet Twisted-3-7. And 7 means 3.
#
# Your task is to create a method, that can sort an array the way it would be sorted on Twisted-3-7.
#
# 7 Examples from a friend from Twisted-3-7:
#
# [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> [1,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,9]
# [12,13,14] -> [12,14,13]
# [9,2,4,7,3] -> [2,7,4,3,9]
# There is no need for a precheck. The array will always be not null and will always contain at least one number.
#
# You should not modify the input array!
#
# Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)
#
# I have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!
