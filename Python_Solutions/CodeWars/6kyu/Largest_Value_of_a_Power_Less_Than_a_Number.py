# Task
# You are given a positive integer (n), and your task is to
# find the largest number less than n, which can be written in the form a**b,
# where a can be any non-negative integer and b is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
# Try not to make the code time out :)
#
# The input range is from 1 to 1,000,000.
#
# Return
# Return your answer in the form (x, y) or ([x, y], depending on the language ), where
# x is the value of a**b, and y is the number of occurrences of a**b. By the way ** means
# ^ or power, so 2 ** 4 = 16. If you are given a number less than or equal to 4, that is
# not 1, return (1, -1), because there is an infinite number of values for it: 1**2, 1**3, 1**4, ....
# If you are given 1, return (0, -1).
#
# Examples
#  3  -->  (1, -1)  # because it's less than 4
#  6  -->  (4, 1)   # because the largest such number below 6 is 4,
#                   # and there is only one way to write it: 2**2
# 65  -->  (64, 3)  # because there are three occurrences of 64: 2**6, 4**3, 8**2
# 90  -->  (81, 2)  # because the largest such number below 90 is 81,
#                   # and there are two ways of getting it: 3**4, 9**2
