# Description:
# Encrypt this!
#
# You want to create secret messages which can be deciphered by the Decipher this! kata. Here are the conditions:
#
# Your message is a string containing space separated words.
# You need to encrypt each word in the message using the following rules:
# The first letter must be converted to its ASCII code.
# The second letter must be switched with the last letter
# Keepin' it simple: There are no special characters in the input.
# Examples:
# encrypt_this("Hello") == "72olle"
# encrypt_this("good") == "103doo"
# encrypt_this("hello world") == "104olle 119drlo"

                new += str(ord(i[j]))
            elif j == 1:
                temp = i[j]
                new += i[-1]
            elif j == len(i) - 1:
                new += temp
            else:
                new += i[j]
