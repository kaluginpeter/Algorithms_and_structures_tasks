# You are given a positive number x
# . Find the smallest positive integer number that has the sum of digits equal to x
#  and all digits are distinct (unique).
#
# Input
# The first line contains a single positive integer t
#  (1≤t≤50
# ) — the number of test cases in the test. Then t
#  test cases follow.
#
# Each test case consists of a single integer number x
#  (1≤x≤50
# ).
#
# Output
# Output t
#  answers to the test cases:
#
# if a positive integer number with the sum of digits equal to x
#  and all digits are different exists, print the smallest such number;
# otherwise print -1.
