# The problem
# In this kata, you're going write a function called point_in_polygon to test if a point is inside a polygon.
#
# Points will be represented as tuples (x,y).
#
# The polygon will be an array of points which are the polygon's vertices. The last point in the array connects back to the first point.
#
# You can assume:
#
# The polygon will be a valid simple polygon. That is, it will have at least three points, none of its edges will cross each other, and exactly two edges will meet at each vertex.
#
# In the tests, the point will never fall exactly on an edge of the polygon.
#
# Testing
# To help you visualize your test cases, the visualize_polygon(polygon, point) function is preloaded. It draws the polygon and point.
