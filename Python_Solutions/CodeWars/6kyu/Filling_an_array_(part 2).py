# Following on from Part 1, part 2 looks at some more complicated array contents.
#
# So let's try filling an array with...
#
# ...square numbers
# The numbers from 1 to n*n
#
# const squares = n => ???
# squares(5) // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
# ...a range of numbers
# A range of numbers starting from start and increasing by step
#
# const range = (n, start, step) => ???
# range(6, 3, 2) // [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
# ...random numbers
# A bunch of random integers between min and max
#
# const random = (n, min, max) => ???
# random(4, 5, 10) // [5, 9, 10, 7]
# ...prime numbers
# All primes starting from 2 (obviously)...
#
# const primes = n => ???
# primes(6) // [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
# HOTE: All the above functions should take as their first
# parameter a number that determines the length of the returned array.
