# In this Kata, you will be given an array of arrays and
# your task will be to return the number of unique arrays
# that can be formed by picking exactly one element from each subarray.
#
# For example: solve([[1,2],[4],[5,6]]) = 4, because it
# results in only 4 possibilites. They are [1,4,5],[1,4,6],[2,4,5],[2,4,6].
#
# Make sure that you don't count duplicates; for example solve([[1,2],[4,4],[5,6,6]]) = 4,
# since the extra outcomes are just duplicates.
#
# See test cases for more examples.
#
# Good luck!
