/*
Given positive integers a and b as strings, evaluate a / b and return the quotient and the remainder as strings in the form [quotient, remainder].

a and b can be very large (at the order of 10^150 to 10^200)
As usual, your result should not have leading 0s
require is disabled in JavaScript. Do it yourself ;-)
