# As part of this Kata, you need to find the length of the sequence in an array, between the first and the second occurrence of a specified number.
#
# For example, for a given array arr
#
# [0, -3, 7, 4, 0, 3, 7, 9]
# Finding length between two 7s like
#
# lengthOfSequence([0, -3, 7, 4, 0, 3, 7, 9], 7)
# would return 5.
#
# For sake of simplicity, there will only be numbers (positive or negative) in the supplied array.
#
# If there are less or more than two occurrences of the number to search for, return 0, or in Haskell, Nothing.
