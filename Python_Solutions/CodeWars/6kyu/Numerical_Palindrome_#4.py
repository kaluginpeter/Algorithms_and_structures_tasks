# A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which
# reads the same backward as forward. Examples of numerical palindromes are:
#
# 2332
# 110011
# 54322345
#
# For a given number num, return its closest numerical palindrome which can either be
# smaller or larger than num. If there are 2 possible values, the larger value should be returned.
# If num is a numerical palindrome itself, return it.
#
# For this kata, single digit numbers will NOT be considered numerical palindromes.
#
# Also, you know the drill - be sure to return "Not valid" if the input is not an integer or is less than 0.
#
# palindrome(8) => 11
# palindrome(281) => 282
# palindrome(1029) => 1001
# palindrome(1221) => 1221
# palindrome("1221") => "Not valid"
