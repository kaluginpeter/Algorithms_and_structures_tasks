# You are given two positive integers a and b.
#
# You can perform the following operations on a so as to obtain b :
#
# (a-1)/2   (if (a-1) is divisible by 2)
# a/2       (if a is divisible by 2)
# a*2
# b will always be a power of 2.
#
# You are to write a function operation(a,b) that efficiently returns the minimum number of operations required to transform a into b.
#
# For example :
#
# operation(2,8) -> 2
# 2*2 = 4
# 4*2 = 8
#
# operation(9,2) -> 2
# (9-1)/2 = 4
# 4/2 = 2
#
# operation(1024,1024) -> 0
