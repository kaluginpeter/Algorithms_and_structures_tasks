# You are given an integer x
# . Your task is to find any integer y
#  (1≤y<x)
#  such that gcd(x,y)+y
#  is maximum possible.
#
# Note that if there is more than one y
#  which satisfies the statement, you are allowed to find any.
#
# gcd(a,b)
#  is the Greatest Common Divisor of a
#  and b
# . For example, gcd(6,4)=2
# .
#
# Input
# The first line contains a single integer t
#  (1≤t≤1000
# ) — the number of test cases.
#
# Each of the following t
#  lines contains a single integer x
#  (2≤x≤1000
# ).
#
# Output
# For each test case, output any y
#  (1≤y<x
# ), which satisfies the statement.
