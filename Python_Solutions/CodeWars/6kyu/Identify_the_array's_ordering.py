# Write a function that takes a single array as an argument (containing multiple strings and/or positive numbers and/or arrays), and returns one of four possible string values, depending on the ordering of the lengths of the elements in the input array:
#
# Your function should return...
#
# “Increasing” - if the lengths of the elements increase from left to right (although it is possible that some neighbouring elements may also be equal in length)
# “Decreasing” - if the lengths of the elements decrease from left to right (although it is possible that some neighbouring elements may also be equal in length)
# “Unsorted” - if the lengths of the elements fluctuate from left to right
# “Constant” - if all element's lengths are the same.
# Numbers and Strings should be evaluated based on the number of characters or digits used to write them.
#
# Arrays should be evaluated based on the number of elements counted directly in the parent array (but not the number of elements contained in any sub-arrays).
#
# Happy coding! :)
