# Imagine a triangle of numbers which follows this pattern:
#
# Starting with the number "1", "1" is positioned at the top of the triangle.
# As this is the 1st row, it can only support a single number.
# The 2nd row can support the next 2 numbers: "2" and "3"
# Likewise, the 3rd row, can only support the next 3 numbers: "4", "5", "6"
# And so on; this pattern continues.
#     1
#    2 3
#   4 5 6
#  7 8 9 10
# ...
# Given N, return the sum of all numbers on the Nth Row:
#
# 1 <= N <= 10,000
