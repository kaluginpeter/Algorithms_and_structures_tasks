# Write a function that takes an integer in input and outputs a string with currency format.
#
# Integer in currency format is expressed by a string of number where every three characters are separated by comma.
#
# For example:
#
# 123456 --> "123,456"
# Input will always be an positive integer, so don't worry about type checking or negative/float values.
