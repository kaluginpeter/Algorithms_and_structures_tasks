# Simply find the closest value to zero from the list. Notice that there are negatives in the list.
#
# List is always not empty and contains only integers. Return None if it is not possible to define only one of such values. And of course, we are expecting 0 as closest value to zero.
#
# Examples:
#
# [2, 4, -1, -3]  => -1
# [5, 2, -2]      => None
# [5, 2, 2]       => 2
# [13, 0, -6]     => 0
