# You are given a binary array a
#  of n
#  elements, a binary array is an array consisting only of 0
# s and 1
# s.
#
# A blank space is a segment of consecutive elements consisting of only 0
# s.
#
# Your task is to find the length of the longest blank space.
#
# Input
# The first line contains a single integer t
#  (1≤t≤1000
# ) — the number of test cases.
#
# The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
#  (1≤n≤100
# ) — the length of the array.
#
# The second line of each test case contains n
#  space-separated integers ai
#  (0≤ai≤1
# ) — the elements of the array.
#
# Output
# For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest blank space.
