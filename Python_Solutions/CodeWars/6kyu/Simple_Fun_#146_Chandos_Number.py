# Task
# The sequence of Chando is an infinite sequence of all Chando's numbers in ascending order.
#
# A number is called Chando's if it is an integer that can be represented as a sum of different positive integer powers of 5.
#
# The first Chando's numbers is 5 (5^1). And the following nth Chando's numbers are:
#
# 25  (5^2)
# 30  (5^1 + 5^2)
# 125 (5^3)
# 130 (5^1 + 5^3)
# 150 (5^2 + 5^3)
# ...
# ...
# Your task is to find the Chando's nth number for a given n.
#
# Input/Output
# [input] integer n
# 1 <= n <= 7000
#
# [output] an integer
# nth Chando's number
