# You are given a string of words and numbers. Extract the expression including:
#
# the operator: either addition ("gains") or subtraction ("loses")
# the two numbers that we are operating on
# Return the result of the calculation.
#
# Notes:
#
# "loses" and "gains" are the only two words describing operators
# No fruit debts nor bitten apples = The numbers are integers and no negatives
# Examples
# "Panda has 48 apples and loses 4"  -->  44
# "Jerry has 34 apples and gains 6"  -->  40
# Should be a nice little kata for you :)
