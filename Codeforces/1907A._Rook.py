# As you probably know, chess is a game that is played on a board with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8
#  grid. Columns of this board are labeled with letters from a to h, and rows are labeled with digits from 1 to 8. Each square is described by the row and column it belongs to.
#
#
# The rook is a piece in the game of chess. During its turn, it may move any non-zero number of squares horizontally or vertically. Your task is to find all possible moves for a rook on an empty chessboard.
#
# Input
# The first line of input contains single integer t
#  (1≤t≤64
# ) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of test cases follow.
#
# Each test case contains one string of two characters, description of the square where rook is positioned. The first character is a letter from a to h, the label of column, and the second character is a digit from 1 to 8, the label of row.
#
# The same position may occur in more than one test case.
#
# Output
# For each test case, output descriptions of all squares where the rook can move, in the same format as in the input.
#
# You can output squares in any order per test case.
