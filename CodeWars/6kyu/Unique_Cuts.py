# Task
# The function is given a string with lower-case characters. Split the string into as many substrings as possible such that each character appears in only one substring. Return the list of lengths of the resulting substrings.
#
# Examples
# "abbccc" ➞ [1, 2, 3]
# # "a", "bb", "ccc"
#
# "abbacdceef" ➞ [4, 3, 2, 1]
# # "abba", "cdc", "ee", "f"
#
# "abacded" ➞ [3, 1, 3]
# # "aba", "c", "ded"
#
# "abcdea" ➞ [6]
# # "abcdea" because first letter is equal to the last letter.
