# Scheduling is how the processor decides which jobs (processes) get to use the processor and for how long. This can cause a lot of problems. Like a really long process taking the entire CPU and freezing all the other processes. One solution is Round-Robin, which today you will be implementing.
#
# Round-Robin works by queuing jobs in a First In First Out fashion, but the processes are only given a short slice of time. If a processes is not finished in that time slice, it yields the proccessor and goes to the back of the queue.
#
# For this Kata you will be implementing the
#
#   def round_robin(jobs, time_slice, index):
# It takes in:
#
# 1. "jobs" a non-empty positive integer array. It represents the queue and clock-cycles(cc) remaining till the job[i] is finished.
#
# 2. "slice" a positive integer. It is the amount of clock-cycles that each job is given till the job yields to the next job in the queue.
#
# 3. "index" a positive integer. Which is the index of the job we're interested in.
# roundRobin returns:
#
# 1. the number of cc till the job at index is finished.
# Here's an example:
#
# roundRobin([10,20,1], 5, 0)
# at 0cc [10,20,1] jobs[0] starts
# after 5cc [5,20,1] jobs[0] yields, jobs[1] starts
# after 10cc [5,15,1] jobs[1] yields, jobs[2] starts
# after 11cc [5,15,0] jobs[2] finishes, jobs[0] starts
# after 16cc [0,15,0] jobs[0] finishes
# so:
#
# roundRobin([10,20,1], 5, 0) == 16
# **You can assume that the processor can switch jobs between cc so it does not add to the total time.
