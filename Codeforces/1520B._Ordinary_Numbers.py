# time limit per test2 seconds
# memory limit per test256 megabytes
# Let's call a positive integer n
#  ordinary if in the decimal notation all its digits are the same. For example, 1
# , 2
#  and 99
#  are ordinary numbers, but 719
#  and 2021
#  are not ordinary numbers.
#
# For a given number n
# , find the number of ordinary numbers among the numbers from 1
#  to n
# .
#
# Input
# The first line contains one integer t
#  (1≤t≤104
# ). Then t
#  test cases follow.
#
# Each test case is characterized by one integer n
#  (1≤n≤109
# ).
#
# Output
# For each test case output the number of ordinary numbers among numbers from 1
#  to n
# .
