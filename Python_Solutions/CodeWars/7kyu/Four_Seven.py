# Four Seven
# Simple kata, simple rules: your function should accept the inputs 4 and 7. If 4 is entered, the function should return 7. If 7 is entered, the function should return 4. Anything else entered as input should return a false-y value such as False, 0, [], "". There's only one catch, your function cannot include if statements (or the eval function due to the fact that you can get around the if requirement using it).

# There are some very simple ways of answering this problem, but I encourage you to try and be as creative as possible.
