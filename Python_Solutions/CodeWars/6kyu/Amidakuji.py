# Amidakuji is a method of lottery designed to create random pairings between two sets comprised of an equal number of elements.
#
# Your task is to write a function amidakuji that returns the final positions of each element. Note that the elements are an ascending sequence of consecutive integers starting with 0 (from left to right).
#
# Input
# Your function will receive an array/list of equal-length strings consisting of 0 and 1 characters; this represents the "ladder" structure. The 1s represent the rungs of the ladder and the 0s represent empty space.
#
# Each element begins at the top of its corresponding vertical rail, as illustrated in the diagram below.
# During the descent of the ladder, whenever a vertical rail intersects a horizontal rung, it swaps values with the adjacent connecting vertical rail.
#
# Output
# Your function should return an array of integers, with each integer in its final position.
#
# Test Example
#
# The diagram above is a visual representation of the test example below. The yellow highlighted path shows the path taken by the 2 value. Each time it encounters a crosspiece, it shifts position.
#
# ladder = [
#     '001001',
#     '010000',
#     '100100',
#     '001000',
#     '100101',
#     '010010',
#     '101001',
#     '010100'
# ]
#
# amidakuji(ladder) # [4, 2, 0, 5, 3, 6, 1]
# Other Technical Details
# A function visualizer is preloaded to help illustrate the structure of the ladder; you can call this function with test inputs
# No two rungs will ever be adjacent (so there is no ambiguity about directional path)
# Full Test Suite: 10 fixed tests and 100 randomly-generated tests
# Test input dimension upper bounds:
# maximum width: 20
# maximum height: 50
# Inputs will always be valid
