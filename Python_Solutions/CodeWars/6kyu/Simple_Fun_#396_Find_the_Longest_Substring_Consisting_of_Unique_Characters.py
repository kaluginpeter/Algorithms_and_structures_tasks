# Task
# You are given a string s. It's a string consist of letters, numbers or symbols.
#
# Your task is to find the Longest substring consisting of unique characters in s, and return the length of it.
#
# Note
# 1 <= s.length <= 10^7
#
# 5 fixed testcases
#
# 100 random testcases, testing for correctness of solution
#
# 100 random testcases, testing for performance of code
#
# All inputs are valid.
#
# Pay attention to code performance.
#
# If my reference solution gives the wrong result in the random tests, please let me know(post an issue).
#
# Example
# For s="baacab", the output should be 3.
#
# The non repeating substrings in s are:
#
# "b","c","a","ba","ac","ca","ab","cab"
# The longest one is "cab", its length is 3.
#
# For s="abcd", the output should be 4.
#
# The longest one is "abcd", its length is 4.
#
# For s="!@#$%^&^%$#@!", the output should be 7.
#
# The longest substring are "!@#$%^&" and "&^%$#@!", their length both are 7.
