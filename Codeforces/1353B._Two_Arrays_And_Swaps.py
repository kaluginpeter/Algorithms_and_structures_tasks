# B. Two Arrays And Swaps
# time limit per test1 second
# memory limit per test256 megabytes
# You are given two arrays a
#  and b
#  both consisting of n
#  positive (greater than zero) integers. You are also given an integer k
# .
#
# In one move, you can choose two indices i
#  and j
#  (1≤i,j≤n
# ) and swap ai
#  and bj
#  (i.e. ai
#  becomes bj
#  and vice versa). Note that i
#  and j
#  can be equal or different (in particular, swap a2
#  with b2
#  or swap a3
#  and b9
#  both are acceptable moves).
#
# Your task is to find the maximum possible sum you can obtain in the array a
#  if you can do no more than (i.e. at most) k
#  such moves (swaps).
#
# You have to answer t
#  independent test cases.
#
# Input
# The first line of the input contains one integer t
#  (1≤t≤200
# ) — the number of test cases. Then t
#  test cases follow.
#
# The first line of the test case contains two integers n
#  and k
#  (1≤n≤30;0≤k≤n
# ) — the number of elements in a
#  and b
#  and the maximum number of moves you can do. The second line of the test case contains n
#  integers a1,a2,…,an
#  (1≤ai≤30
# ), where ai
#  is the i
# -th element of a
# . The third line of the test case contains n
#  integers b1,b2,…,bn
#  (1≤bi≤30
# ), where bi
#  is the i
# -th element of b
# .
#
# Output
# For each test case, print the answer — the maximum possible sum you can obtain in the array a
#  if you can do no more than (i.e. at most) k
#  swaps.

# Note
# In the first test case of the example, you can swap a1=1
#  and b2=4
# , so a=[4,2]
#  and b=[3,1]
# .
#
# In the second test case of the example, you don't need to swap anything.
#
# In the third test case of the example, you can swap a1=1
#  and b1=10
# , a3=3
#  and b3=10
#  and a2=2
#  and b4=10
# , so a=[10,10,10,4,5]
#  and b=[1,9,3,2,9]
# .
#
# In the fourth test case of the example, you cannot swap anything.
#
# In the fifth test case of the example, you can swap arrays a
#  and b
# , so a=[4,4,5,4]
#  and b=[1,2,2,1]
