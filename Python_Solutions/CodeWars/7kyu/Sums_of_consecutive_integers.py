# The sum of x consecutive integers is y. What is the consecutive integer at position n? Given x, y, and n, solve for the integer. Assume the starting position is 0.
#
# For example, if the sum of 4 consecutive integers is 14, what is the consecutive integer at position 3?
#
# We find that the consecutive integers are [2, 3, 4, 5], so the integer at position 3 is 5.
#
# position(4, 14, 3) == 5
# Assume there will always be a sum of x consecutive integers that totals to y and n will never be indexed out of bounds.
