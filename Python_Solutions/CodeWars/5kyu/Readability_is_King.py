# We will use the Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level to evaluate the readability of a piece of text. This grade level is an approximation for what schoolchildren are able to understand a piece of text. For example, a piece of text with a grade level of 7 can be read by seventh-graders and beyond.
#
# The way to calculate the grade level is as follows:
#
# (0.39 * average number of words per sentence) + (11.8 * average number of syllables per word) - 15.59
# Write a function that will calculate the Flesch–Kincaid grade level for any given string. Return the grade level rounded to two decimal points.
#
# Ignore hyphens, dashes, apostrophes, parentheses, ellipses and abbreviations.
#
# Remember that the text can contain more than one sentence: code accordingly!
#
# HINT: Count the number of vowels as an approximation for the number of syllables, but count groups of vowels as one (e.g. deal is one syllable). Do not count y as a vowel!
#
# Example
# "The turtle is leaving." ==> 3.67
# The average number of words per sentence is 4 and the average number of syllables per word is 1.5. The score is then (0.39 * 4) +  (11.8 * 1.5) - 15.59 = 3.67
