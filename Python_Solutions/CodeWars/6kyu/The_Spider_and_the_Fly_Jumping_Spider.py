# Background
# A spider web is defined by
#
# "rings" numbered out from the centre as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
#
# "radials" labelled clock-wise from the top as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H
#
# Here is a picture to help explain:
#
# source: imgur.com
# Web Coordinates
# As you can see, each point where the rings and the radials intersect can be described by a "web coordinate".
#
# So in this example the spider is at H3 and the fly is at E2
#
# Kata Task
# Our friendly jumping spider is resting and minding his own spidery business at web-coordinate spider.
#
# An inattentive fly bumbles into the web at web-coordinate fly and gets itself stuck.
#
# Your task is to calculate and return the distance the spider must jump to get to the fly.
#
# Example
# The solution to the scenario described by the picture is 4.63522
#
# Notes
# The centre of the web will always be referred to as A0
# The rings intersect the radials at evenly spaced distances of 1 unit
# Good Luck!
