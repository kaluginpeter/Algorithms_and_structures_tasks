# Given a name, turn that name into a perfect square matrix (nested array with the amount of arrays equivalent to the length of each array).
#
# You will need to add periods (.) to the end of the name if necessary, to turn it into a matrix.
#
# If the name has a length of 0, return "name must be at least one letter"
#
# Examples
# "Bill" ==> [ ["B", "i"],
#              ["l", "l"] ]
#
# "Frank" ==> [ ["F", "r", "a"],
#               ["n", "k", "."],
#               [".", ".", "."] ]
