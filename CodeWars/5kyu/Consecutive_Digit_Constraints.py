# This kata is based on Project Euler Problem 164
#
# Objective
# Write a function that takes a number n and returns the number of n digit numbers (without leading zeros) that no three consecutive digits have a sum greater than 9
#
# Examples
# | n  |  number of numbers
# |--------------------------
# | 1  |  9 (0 doesn't count)
# | 2  | 45
# | 3  | 165
# Note:
# n ranges from 1 to 500
# Code length limit = 5000 to avoid hard coded solutions
