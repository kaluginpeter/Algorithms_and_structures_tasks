# B. Upscaling

# memory limit per test256 megabytes
# You are given an integer n
# . Output a 2n×2n
#  checkerboard made of 2×2
#  squares alternating '#
# ' and '.
# ', with the top-left cell being '#
# '.
#
#
# The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4
# .
#
# Input
# The first line contains an integer t
#  (1≤t≤20
# ) — the number of test cases.
#
# The only line of each test case contains a single integer n
#  (1≤n≤20
# ) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n
# .
#
# Output
# For each test case, output 2n
#  lines, each containing 2n
#  characters without spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty lines between test cases.
