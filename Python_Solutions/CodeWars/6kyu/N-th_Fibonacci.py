# I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others.
#
# I would like for you to write me a function that, when given a number n (n >= 1 ),
# returns the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence.
#
# For example:
#
#    nth_fib(4) == 2
# Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.
#
# For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each
# subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

# Solution
def nth_fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n-1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
