# In this Kata, you will create a function that converts a string with letters and numbers
# to the inverse of that string (with regards to Alpha and Numeric characters).
# So, e.g. the letter a will become 1 and number 1 will become a; z will become 26 and 26 will become z.
#
# Example: "a25bz" would become "1y226"
#
# Numbers representing letters (n <= 26) will always be separated by letters, for all test cases:
#
# "a26b" may be tested, but not "a262b"
# "cjw9k" may be tested, but not "cjw99k"
# A list named alphabet is preloaded for you: ['a', 'b', 'c', ...]
#
# A dictionary of letters and their number equivalent is also preloaded for you called
# alphabetnums = {'a': '1', 'b': '2', 'c': '3', ...}
