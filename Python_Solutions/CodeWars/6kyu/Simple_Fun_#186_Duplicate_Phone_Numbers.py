# Task
# Businesses like to have memorable telephone numbers. One way to make a telephone number memorable is to have it spell a memorable word or phrase.
#
# For example, you can call the University of Waterloo by dialing the memorable TUT-GLOP. Sometimes only part of the number is used to spell a word. When you get back to your hotel tonight you can order a pizza from Gino's by dialing 310-GINO.
#
# The standard form of a telephone number is seven decimal digits with a hyphen between the third and fourth digits (e.g. 888-1200). The keypad of a phone supplies the mapping of letters to numbers, as follows:
#
# A, B, and C map to 2
# D, E, and F map to 3
# G, H, and I map to 4
# J, K, and L map to 5
# M, N, and O map to 6
# P, R, and S map to 7
# T, U, and V map to 8
# W, X, and Y map to 9
# letters can be uppercase or lowercase
# There is no mapping for Q(q) or Z(z). Hyphens are not dialed, and can be added and removed as necessary. The standard form of TUT-GLOP is 888-4567, the standard form of 310-GINO is 310-4466, and the standard form of 3-10-10-10 is 310-1010.
#
# Two telephone numbers are equivalent if they have the same standard form. (They dial the same number.)
#
# Given a list phoneNumbers, your task is to find the duplicate telephone number in the list. Return an array like this:
#
# ["310-1010:2","487-3279:4","888-4567:3"]
#
# The form of each element is standard form + : + numbers of duplicate
#
# Input/Output
# [input] string array phoneNumbers
# The list of the telephone numbers. Each telephone number consists of a string composed of decimal digits, letters (excluding Q and Z) and hyphens. Exactly seven of the characters in the string will be digits or letters.
#
# [output] a string array
# The duplicate telephone number list. Arrange the output string by telephone number in ascending lexicographical order. If there are no duplicates in the input return [].
#
# #Example
# For phoneNumbers =
#
# [
# "7399425",
# "SEXY-GAL",
# "Sexy-GAL",
# "sexy-gal",
# "SEXY-425",
# "S-E-X-Y-G-A-L"
# ]
# The output should be:
#
# ["739-9425:6"]
