# You are given an array that of arbitrary depth that needs to be nearly
# flattened into a 2 dimensional array. The given array's depth is also non-uniform,
# so some parts may be deeper than others.
#
# All of lowest level arrays (most deeply nested) will contain only integers and none
# of the higher level arrays will contain anything but other arrays.
# All arrays given will be at least 2 dimensional. All lowest level arrays will contain at least one element.
#
# Your solution should be an array containing all of the lowest level arrays and only these.
# The sub-arrays should be ordered by the smallest element within each, so [1,2] should preceed [3,4,5].
# Note: integers will not be repeated.
#
# For example:
#
# If you receive [[[1,2,3],[4,5]],[6,7]], your answer should be [[1,2,3],[4,5],[6,7]].
