# You're operating behind enemy lines, but your decryption device took a bullet and no longer operates. You need to write a code to unscramble the encrypted messages coming in from headquarters. Luckily, you remember how the encryption algorithm works.
#
# Each message you receive is a single string, with the blocks for each letter separated by a space. The blocks encoding the characters are made up of seemingly random characters and are of a variable length. For example, a two character word might look like:
#
# "x20*6<xY y_r9L"
# To decode this string, you add up only the numbers in each block:
#
# sum of integers in "x20*6<xY" --> 2 + 0 + 6 = 8
# sum of integers in "y_r9L" --> 9
# Then map these numbers to the corresponding letters of the alphabet, with 0 representing a space:
#
# 0  : ' '
# 1  : 'a'
# 2  : 'b'
# ...
# 26 : 'z'
# So we have:
#
# "x20*6<xY y_r9L" --> "8 9" --> "hi"
# Note also, if the sum of the digits goes over 26, loop back to zero (standard modulo / remainder function, such that 27 == 0, 28 == 1, etc.). As such the previous code could have also been:
#
# "x20*6<xY y875_r97L" --> "8 36" --> "8 9" --> "hi"
# FUNDAMENTALS
# Solution
