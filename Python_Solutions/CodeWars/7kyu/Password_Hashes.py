# When you sign up for an account somewhere, some websites do not actually store your password in their databases. Instead, they will transform your password into something else using a cryptographic hashing algorithm.
#
# After the password is transformed, it is then called a password hash. Whenever you try to login, the website will transform the password you tried using the same hashing algorithm and simply see if the password hashes are the same.
#
# Create the function that converts a given string into an md5 hash. The return value should be encoded in hexadecimal.
#
# Code Examples
# passHash("password") // --> "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99"
# passHash("abc123") // --> "e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03"
# If you want to externally test a string, look at this website.
#
# As a side note, md5 can be exploited, so never use it for anything secure. The reason I used it in this kata is simply because it is a very common hashing algorithm and many people will recognize the name.
