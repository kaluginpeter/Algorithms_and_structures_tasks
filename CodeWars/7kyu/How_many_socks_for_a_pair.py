# I have a number of different colours of socks mixed up in a drawer and I require a number of matching pairs of socks. Fortunately, I don't mind what colour the pairs are and I have an infinite number of each colour of sock.
#
# Your task is to create a function with inputs colours and pairs that returns the minimum number of socks that I would have to take from my drawer to guarantee pairs number of matching pairs.
#
# Example:
# for colours = 2, pairs = 1, return 3, because it takes 3 socks to guarantee 1 pair of socks with 2 different possible colours to select from.
#
# More examples:
#
# for colours = 1, pairs = 2: return 4
# for colours = 2, pairs = 3: return 7
# for colours = 4, pairs = 2: return 7
# for colours = 4, pairs = 4: return 11
# Note: colours and pairs are both positive integers.
