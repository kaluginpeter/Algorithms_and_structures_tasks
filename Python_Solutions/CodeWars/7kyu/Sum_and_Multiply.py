# Write a function that accepts two parameters (sum and multiply) and find two numbers [x, y], where x + y = sum and x * y = multiply.
#
# Example:
#
# sum = 12 and multiply = 32
#
# In this case, x equals 4 and y equals 8.
#
# x = 4
#
# y = 8
#
# Because
#
# x + y = 4 + 8 = 12 = sum
#
# x * y = 4 * 8 = 32 = multiply
#
# The result should be [4, 8].
#
# Note:
#
# 0 <= x <= 1000
#
# 0 <= y <= 1000
#
# If there is no solution, your function should return null (or None in python).
#
# You should return an array (list in python) containing the two values [x, y] and it should be sorted in ascending order.
#
# One last thing: x and y are integers (no decimals).
