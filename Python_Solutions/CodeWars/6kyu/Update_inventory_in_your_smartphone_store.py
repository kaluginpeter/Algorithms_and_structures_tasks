# You will be given an array which lists the current inventory of stock in your store and another array which lists the new inventory being delivered to your store today.
#
# Your task is to write a function that returns the updated list of your current inventory in alphabetical order.
#
# Example
# cur_stock = [(25, 'HTC'), (1000, 'Nokia'), (50, 'Samsung'), (33, 'Sony'), (10, 'Apple')]
# new_stock = [(5, 'LG'), (10, 'Sony'), (4, 'Samsung'), (5, 'Apple')]
#
# update_inventory(cur_stock, new_stock)  ==>
# [(15, 'Apple'), (25, 'HTC'), (5, 'LG'), (1000, 'Nokia'), (54, 'Samsung'), (43, 'Sony')]
# Kata inspired by the FreeCodeCamp's 'Inventory Update' algorithm.
