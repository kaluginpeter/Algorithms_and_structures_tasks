# Given two forces (F1 and F2 ) and the angle F2 makes with F1 find the resultant force R and the angle it makes with F1.
#
# input
# Three values :
#
# F1
# F2 making an angle θ with F1
# angle θ
# output
# An array consisting of two values :
#
# R (the resultant force)
# angle R makes with F1 (φ)
# notes
# Units for each of the following are given as under :
#
# F1 = Newton
# F2 = Newton
# angle θ = degree
# R = Newton
# φ = degree
