# Your task is to write a function that does just what the title suggests
# (so, fair warning, be aware that you are not getting out of it just throwing
# a lame bas sorting method there) with an array/list/vector of integers and
# the expected number n of smallest elements to return.
#
# Also:
#
# the number of elements to be returned cannot be higher than the array/list/vector length;
# elements can be duplicated;
# in case of duplicates, just return them according to the original order (see third example for more clarity).
# Same examples and more in the test cases:
#
# first_n_smallest([1,2,3,4,5],3) == [1,2,3]
# first_n_smallest([5,4,3,2,1],3) == [3,2,1]
# first_n_smallest([1,2,3,4,1],3) == [1,2,1]
# first_n_smallest([1,2,3,-4,0],3) == [1,-4,0]
# first_n_smallest([1,2,3,4,5],0) == []
