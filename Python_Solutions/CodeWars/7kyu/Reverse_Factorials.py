# I'm sure you're familiar with factorials â€“ that is, the product of an integer and all the integers below it.
#
# For example, 5! = 120, as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
#
# Your challenge is to create a function that takes any number and returns the number that it is a factorial of. So, if your function receives 120, it should return "5!" (as a string).
#
# Of course, not every number is a factorial of another. In this case, your function would return "None" (as a string).
#
# Examples
# 120 will return "5!"
# 24 will return "4!"
# 150 will return "None"
# FUNDAMENTALS
# Solution
from math import factorial
def reverse_factorial(num):
    c = 1
    while factorial(c) < num: c += 1
    return str(c) + '!' if factorial(c) == num else 'None'
