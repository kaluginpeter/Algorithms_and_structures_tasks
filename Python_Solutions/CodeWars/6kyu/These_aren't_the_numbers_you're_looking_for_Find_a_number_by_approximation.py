# You should find a searched number by approximation.
#
# The searched number will always be between 0 and 100.
#
# You have to write a method, that will get only a function to compare your guess number with the searched number.
# Your method have to find the number with a precision of 5 fractional digits.
# The tolerance for the value: The difference from the searched number must be smaller than 0.00002.
#
# The compare-function, that your method will get as parameter, takes the guessed number as parameter and returns 0 for the correct number, -1 if your number is smaller than the searched number and 1 if your guessed number is greater than the searched number.
#
# Example:
# Searched number: 6
#
# Compare(1); -> -1
# Compare(10); -> 1
# Compare(6); -> 0
# You do not need a Compare-Call, that returns 0. If your number has a precision of 5 fractional digits, and you are sure, it is the searched number, you can return the number.
#
# You will always get the compare-method! So there is no need for a check for null.
