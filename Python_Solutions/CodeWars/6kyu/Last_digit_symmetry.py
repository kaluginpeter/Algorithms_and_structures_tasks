# Consider the number 1176 and its square (1176 * 1176) = 1382976. Notice that:
#
# the first two digits of 1176 form a prime.
# the first two digits of the square 1382976 also form a prime.
# the last two digits of 1176 and 1382976 are the same.
# Given two numbers representing a range (a, b), how many numbers satisfy this property within that range? (a <= n < b)
#
# Example
# solve(2, 1200) = 1, because only 1176 satisfies this property within the range 2 <= n < 1200.
# See test cases for more examples. The upper bound for the range will not exceed 1,000,000.

# Good luck!
