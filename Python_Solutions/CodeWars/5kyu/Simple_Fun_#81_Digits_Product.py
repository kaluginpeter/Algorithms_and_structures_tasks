# Task
# Given an integer product, find the smallest positive integer the product of whose digits is equal to product. If there is no such integer, return -1 instead.
#
# Example
# For product = 1, the output should be 11;
#
# 1 x 1 = 1 (1 is not a valid result, because it has only 1 digit)
#
# For product = 12, the output should be 26;
#
# 2 x 6 = 12
#
# For product = 19, the output should be -1.
#
# No valid result found.
#
# For product = 450, the output should be 2559.
#
# 2 x 5 x 5 x 9 = 450
#
# For product = 581, the output should be -1.
#
# No valid result found.
#
# Someone says the output should be 783, because 7 x 83 = 581.
#
# Please note: 83 is not a DIGIT.
#
# Input/Output
# [input] integer product
#
# Constraints: 0 ≤ product ≤ 600.
#
# [output] a positive integer
