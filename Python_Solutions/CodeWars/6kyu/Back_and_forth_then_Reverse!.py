# Task
# A list S will be given. You need to generate a list T from it by following the given process:
#
# Remove the first and last element from the list S and add them to the list T.
# Reverse the list S
# Repeat the process until list S gets emptied.
# The above process results in the depletion of the list S.
# Your task is to generate list T without mutating the input List S.
#
# Example
# S = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# T = []
#
# S = [2,3,4,5] => [5,4,3,2]
# T = [1,6]
#
# S = [4,3] => [3,4]
# T = [1,6,5,2]
#
# S = []
# T = [1,6,5,2,3,4]
# return T
# Note
# size of S goes up to 10^6
# Keep the efficiency of your code in mind.
# Do not mutate the Input.
