# You are given an n by n ( square ) grid of characters, for example:
#
# [['m', 'y', 'e'],
#  ['x', 'a', 'm'],
#  ['p', 'l', 'e']]
# You are also given a list of integers as input, for example:
#
# [1, 3, 5, 8]
# You have to find the characters in these indexes of the grid if you think of the indexes as:
#
# [[1, 2, 3],
#  [4, 5, 6],
#  [7, 8, 9]]
# Remember that the indexes start from one and not zero.
#
# Then you output a string like this:
#
# "meal"
# All inputs will be valid.
