# A. Shortest Path with Obstacle
# time limit per test2 seconds
# memory limit per test512 megabytes
# There are three cells on an infinite 2-dimensional grid, labeled A
# , B
# , and F
# . Find the length of the shortest path from A
#  to B
#  if:
#
# in one move you can go to any of the four adjacent cells sharing a side;
# visiting the cell F
#  is forbidden (it is an obstacle).
# Input
# The first line contains an integer t
#  (1≤t≤104
# ) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t
#  test cases follow. Before each test case, there is an empty line.
#
# Each test case contains three lines. The first one contains two integers xA,yA
#  (1≤xA,yA≤1000
# ) — coordinates of the start cell A
# . The second one contains two integers xB,yB
#  (1≤xB,yB≤1000
# ) — coordinates of the finish cell B
# . The third one contains two integers xF,yF
#  (1≤xF,yF≤1000
# ) — coordinates of the forbidden cell F
# . All cells are distinct.
#
# Coordinate x
#  corresponds to the column number and coordinate y
#  corresponds to the row number (see the pictures below).
#
# Output
# Output t
#  lines. The i
# -th line should contain the answer for the i
# -th test case: the length of the shortest path from the cell A
#  to the cell B
#  if the cell F
#  is not allowed to be visited.
