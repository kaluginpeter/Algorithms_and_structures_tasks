#
# Your task is to create a list of brands ordered by popularity, if two brands have the same popularity level then choose the one which was opened last from the two and second the other one.
#
# Product popularity is calculated from the history. If a product is more times in the history than it is more popular.
#
# Your function will have one parameter which will be always an array/list of object.
#
# example product: { name: "Phone", price: 25, brand: "Fake brand" }
