# Our cells go through a process called protein synthesis to translate the
# instructions in DNA into an amino acid chain, or polypeptide.
#
# Your job is to replicate this!
#
# Step 1: Transcription
#
# Your input will be a string of DNA that looks like this:
#
# "TACAGCTCGCTATGAATC"
#
# You then must transcribe it to mRNA. Each letter, or base, gets transcribed.
#
# A -> U
# G -> C
# C -> G```
#
# Also, you will split it into groups of three, or _codons_.
#
# The above example would become:
#
# `"AUG UCG AGC GAU ACU UAG"`
#
# ---
#
# **Step 2: Translation**
#
# After you have the mRNA strand, you will turn it into an amino acid chain.
#
# Each codon corresponds to an amino acid:
# Ala GCU, GCC, GCA, GCG Leu UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG Arg CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG,
# AGA, AGG Lys AAA, AAG Asn AAU, AAC Met AUG Asp GAU, GAC Phe UUU, UUC Cys UGU, UGC
# Pro CCU, CCC, CCA, CCG Gln CAA, CAG Ser UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU, AGC Glu GAA, GAG
# Thr ACU, ACC, ACA, ACG Gly GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG Trp UGG His CAU, CAC Tyr UAU, UAC Ile
# AUU, AUC, AUA Val GUU, GUC, GUA, GUG Stop UAG, UGA, UAA```
#
# Phew, that's a long list!
#
# The above example would become:
#
# "Met Ser Ser Thr Asp Stop"
#
# Any additional sets of bases that aren't in a group of three aren't included. For example:
#
# "AUG C"
#
# would become
#
# "Met"
#
# Anyway, your final output will be the mRNA sequence and the polypeptide.
#
# Here are some examples:
#
# In:
#
# "TACAGCTCGCTATGAATC"
#
# Out:
#
# ["AUG UCG AGC GAU ACU UAG","Met Ser Ser Asp Thr Stop"]
#
# In:
#
# "ACGTG"
#
# Out:
#
# ["UGC AC","Cys"]
