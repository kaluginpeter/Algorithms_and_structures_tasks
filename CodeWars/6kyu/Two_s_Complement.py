# The goal is to write a pair of functions the first of which will take a string of binary along with a specification of bits, which will return a numeric, signed complement in two's complement format. The second will do the reverse. It will take in an integer along with a number of bits, and return a binary string.

#
# Thus, to_twos_complement should take the parameters binary = "0000 0001", bits = 8 should return 1. And, binary = "11111111", bits = 8 should return -1 . While, from_twos_complement should return "00000000" from the parameters n = 0, bits = 8 . And, "11111111" from n = -1, bits = 8.

# You should account for some edge cases.
