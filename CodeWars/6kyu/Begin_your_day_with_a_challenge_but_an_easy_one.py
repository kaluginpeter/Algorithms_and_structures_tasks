# There are no explanations. You have to create the code that gives the following results in Python, Ruby, and Haskell:
#
# one_two_three(0) == [0, 0]
# one_two_three(1) == [1, 1]
# one_two_three(2) == [2, 11]
# one_two_three(3) == [3, 111]
# one_two_three(19) == [991, 1111111111111111111]
# And it should give the following results in Javascript, Scala, D, Go, Rust, C, and Java:
#
# oneTwoThree(0) == ['0', '0']
# oneTwoThree(1) == ['1', '1']
# oneTwoThree(3) == ['3', '111']
# oneTwoThree(19) == ['991', '1111111111111111111']
# In C, the results are to be assigned to seperate pointers.
