# In this Kata, you will be given a list of strings and your task will be to
# find the strings that have the same characters and return the sum of their positions as follows:
#
# solve(["abc","abbc", "ab", "xyz", "xy", "zzyx"]) = [1,8]
# -- we see that the elements at indices 0 and 1 have the same characters, as do those at indices 3 and 5.
# -- we therefore return [1,8] because [0+1,3+5] = [1,8]. This result is sorted.
# -- ignore those that don't have at least one matching partner, such as "ab" and "xy".
#
# Another example...
# solve(["wkskkkkkk","fokoo","wkskk","uizzzz","fokooff","wkskkkk","uizzzzzzz"]),[5,7,9]);
# --The element at index 0 is similar to those at indices 2 and 5; so 0 + 2 + 5 = 7.
# --The element at index 1 is similar to that at index 4; so 1 + 4 = 5.
# --The element at index 3 is similar to that at index 6; so 3 + 6 = 9.
# --The result must be sorted. We get [5,7,9].
# More examples in the test cases.
#
# Good luck!
