#
# Your task
# Your task is to create a function encryptor
# that takes 2 arguments - key and message - and returns the encrypted message.
#
# Make sure to only shift letters, and be sure to keep the cases of the letters the same.
# All punctuation, numbers, spaces, and so on should remain the same.
#
# Also be aware of keys greater than 26 and less than -26. There's only 26 letters in the alphabet!
#
# Examples
# A message 'Caesar Cipher' and a key of 1 returns 'Dbftbs Djqifs'.
#
# A message 'Caesar Cipher' and a key of -1 returns 'Bzdrzq Bhogdq'.
