# My 5th kata, and 1st in a planned series of rock climbing themed katas.
#
# In rock climbing (bouldering specifically), the V/Vermin (USA) climbing grades start at 'VB' (the easiest grade), and then go 'V0', 'V0+', 'V1', 'V2', 'V3', 'V4', 'V5' etc. up to 'V17' (the hardest grade).
#
# You will be given a list of climbing grades and you have to write a function to return a list of the grades sorted easiest to hardest.
#
# If the input is an empty list, return an empty list; otherwise the input will always be a valid list of one or more grades.
#
# Please do vote, rank, and provide any feedback on the kata.
