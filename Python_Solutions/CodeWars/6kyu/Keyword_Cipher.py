# Third day at your new cryptoanalyst job and you come across your toughest assignment yet.
# Your job is to implement a simple keyword cipher. A keyword cipher is a type of monoalphabetic
# substitution where two parameters are provided as such (string, keyword). The string is encrypted
# by taking the keyword, dropping any letters that appear more than once. The rest of the letters of
# the alphabet that aren't used are then appended to the end of the keyword.
#
# For example, if your string was "hello" and your keyword was "wednesday", your encryption key
# would be 'wednsaybcfghijklmopqrtuvxz'.
#
# To encrypt 'hello' you'd substitute as follows,
#
#               abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
#   hello ==>   |||||||||||||||||||||||||| ==> bshhk
#               wednsaybcfghijklmopqrtuvxz
# hello encrypts into bshhk with the keyword wednesday. This cipher also uses lower case letters only.
#
# Good Luck.
