# Hey You !
# Sort these integers for me ...
#
# By name ...
#
# Do it now !
#
# Input
# Range is 0-999
#
# There may be duplicates
#
# The array may be empty
#
# Example
# Input: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Equivalent names: "one", "two", "three", "four"
# Sorted by name: "four", "one", "three", "two"
# Output: 4, 1, 3, 2
# Notes
# Don't pack words together:
# e.g. 99 may be "ninety nine" or "ninety-nine"; but not "ninetynine"
# e.g 101 may be "one hundred one" or "one hundred and one"; but not "onehundredone"
# Don't fret about formatting rules, because if rules are consistently applied it has no effect anyway:
# e.g. "one hundred one", "one hundred two"; is same order as "one hundred and one", "one hundred and two"
# e.g. "ninety eight", "ninety nine"; is same order as "ninety-eight", "ninety-nine"
