# Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.
#
# For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.
#
# Constraint:
#
# 1 <= month <= 12
# FUNDAMENTALSMATHEMATICS
# Solution
