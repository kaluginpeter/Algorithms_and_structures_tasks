# Lexicographic permutations are ordered combinations of a set of items ordered in a specific way.
#
# For instance, the first 8 permutations of the digits 0123, in lexicographic order, are:
#
# 1st 0123
# 2nd 0132
# 3rd 0213
# 4th 0231
# 5th 0312
# 6th 0321
# 7th 1023
# 8th 1032
# Your task is to write a function L( n, d ) that will return a string representing the nth permutation of the d digit, starting with 0 (i.e. d=10 means all digits 0123456789).
#
# So for d = 4, L(7,4) should return '1023', and L(4,4) should return '0231' .
#
# Some things to bear in mind:
#
# • The function should return a string, otherwise permutations beginning with a 0 will have it removed.
#
# • Test cases will not exceed the highest possible valid values for n
#
# • The function should work for any d between 1 and 10.
#
# • A value of 1 for n means the 1st permutation, so n = 0 is not a valid input.
#
# • Oh, and no itertools ;)
