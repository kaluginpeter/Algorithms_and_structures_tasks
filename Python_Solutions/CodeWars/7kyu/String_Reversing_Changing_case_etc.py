# Given 2 string parameters, show a concatenation of:
#
# the reverse of the 2nd string with inverted case; e.g Fish -> HSIf
# a separator in between both strings: @@@
# the 1st string reversed with inverted case and then mirrored; e.g Water -> RETAwwATER
# ** Keep in mind that this kata was initially designed for Shell, I'm aware it may be easier in other languages.**
