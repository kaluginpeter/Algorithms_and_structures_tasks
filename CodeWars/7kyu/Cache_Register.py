# In this Kata, your goal is to write a financial function with memory!
#
# Given a numeric input, register_transaction should format it as a string rounded to two decimals of precision, with a comma as the thousands separator, a period as the decimal separator, and a dollar sign in front. (Use the "round half to even" rounding method, which is the default behavior of round in Python and Javascript.) For example, 1000.557 should be rendered as "$1,000.56". If the input is less than one, use a leading zero for the dollars place. That is, render 0.2 as "$0.20".
#
# But that's not all! Like a predatory bookie at the racetrack, register_transaction should keep a running tally of every transaction registered with it. After formatting the input, the function should output an ordered list (or array) of all transactions ever registered with the functionâ€”with the new transaction at the end of the list.
#
# You may assume that all function inputs will be valid integers or floats.
#
# Example:
#
# register_transaction(15) -> ["$15.00"]
# register_transaction(10) -> ["$15.00", "$10.00"]
