# Base on the fairy tale Diamonds and Toads from Charles Perrault. In this kata you will have to complete a function that take 2 arguments:
#
# A string, that correspond to what the daugther says.
# A string, that tell you wich fairy the girl have met, this one can be good or evil.
# The function should return the following count as a hash:
#
# If the girl have met the good fairy:
# count 1 ruby everytime you see a r and 2 everytime you see a R
# count 1 crystal everytime you see a c and 2 everytime you see a C
# If the girl have met the evil fairy:
# count 1 python everytime you see a p and 2 everytime uou see a P
# count 1 squirrel everytime you see a s and 2 everytime you see a S
# Note: For this kata I decided to remplace the normal Diamonds and Toads by some programming languages. And just discover that Squirrel is a programming language.
