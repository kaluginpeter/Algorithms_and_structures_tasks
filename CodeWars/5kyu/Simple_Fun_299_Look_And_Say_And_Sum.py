# Task
# Get the digits sum of nth number from the Look-and-Say sequence(1-based).
#
# 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, ...
#
# Input/Output
# [input] integer n
#
# nth number in the sequence to get, where 1 <= n <= 55 and n=1 is "1".
#
# [output] an integer
#
# The sum of digits in nth number from the Look-and-Say sequence.
#
# Example
# For n = 2, the output should be 2.
#
# "11" --> 1 + 1 --> 2
#
# For n = 3, the output should be 3.
#
# "21" --> 2 + 1 --> 3
#
# For n = 4, the output should be 5.
#
# "1211" --> 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 --> 5
