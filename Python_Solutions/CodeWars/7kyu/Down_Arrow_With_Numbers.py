# Given a number n, make a down arrow shaped pattern.
#
# For example, when n = 5, the output would be:
#
# 123454321
#  1234321
#   12321
#    121
#     1
# and for n = 11, it would be:
#
# 123456789010987654321
#  1234567890987654321
#   12345678987654321
#    123456787654321
#     1234567654321
#      12345654321
#       123454321
#        1234321
#         12321
#          121
#           1
#
# An important thing to note in the above example is that the numbers greater than 9 still stay single digit, like after 9 it would be 0 - 9 again instead of 10 - 19.
#
# Note:
#
# There are spaces for the indentation on the left of each line and no spaces on the right.
# Return "" if given n<1.
# Have fun!
