# Task
# We have a NÃ—N matrix (N<10) and a robot.
#
# We wrote in each point of matrix x and y coordinates of a point of matrix.
#
# When robot goes to a point of matrix, reads x and y and transfer to point with x and y coordinates.
#
# For each point in the matrix we want to know if robot returns back to it after EXACTLY k moves. So your task is to count points to which Robot returns in EXACTLY k moves.
#
# You should stop counting moves as soon as the robot returns to the starting point. That is, if the robot returns to the starting point in fewer than k moves, that point should not count as a valid point.
#
# example
# For:
#
# matrix=[
# ["0,1","0,0","1,2"],
# ["1,1","1,0","0,2"],
# ["2,1","2,0","0,0"]]
# k= 2
# The result should be 8
#
# Robot start at (0,0) --> (0,1) --> (0,0), total 2 moves
# Robot start at (0,1) --> (0,0) --> (0,1), total 2 moves
# Robot start at (0,2) --> (1,2) --> (0,2), total 2 moves
# Robot start at (1,2) --> (0,2) --> (1,2), total 2 moves
# Robot start at (1,0) --> (1,1) --> (1,0), total 2 moves
# Robot start at (1,1) --> (1,0) --> (1,1), total 2 moves
# Robot start at (2,0) --> (2,1) --> (2,0), total 2 moves
# Robot start at (2,1) --> (2,0) --> (2,1), total 2 moves
# Robot start at (2,2) --> (0,0) --> (0,1) --> (0,0) --> (0,1) ....
# (Robot can not transfer back to 2,2)
# So the result is 8.
