# Your friend Robbie has successfully created an AI that is capable of communicating in English!
#
# Robbie's almost done with the project, however the machine's output isn't working as expected. Here's a sample of a sentence that it outputs:
#
# ["this","is","a","sentence"]
# Every time that it tries to say a sentence, instead of formatting it in normal English orthography, it just outputs a list of words.
#
# Robbie has pulled multiple all-nighters to get this project finished, and he needs some beauty sleep. So, he wants you to write the last part of his code, a sentencify function, which takes the output that the machine gives, and formats it into proper English orthography.
#
# Your function should:
#
# Capitalise the first letter of the first word.
# Add a period (.) to the end of the sentence.
# Join the words into a complete string, with spaces.
# Do no other manipulation on the words.
# Here are a few examples of what your function should do:
#
# Input	Output
# ["i", "am", "an", "AI"]	"I am an AI."
# ["FIELDS","of","CORN","are","to","be","sown"]	"FIELDS of CORN are to be sown."
# ["i'm","afraid","I","can't","let","you","do","that"]	"I'm afraid I can't let you do that."
# (Any translations (eg: to Java/C#/C++/Typescript) would be greatly appreciated!)
