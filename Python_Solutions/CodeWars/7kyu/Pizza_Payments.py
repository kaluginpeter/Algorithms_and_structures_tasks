# Kate and Michael want to buy a pizza and share it. Depending on the price of the pizza, they are going to divide the costs:
#
# If the pizza is less than €5,- Michael invites Kate, so Michael pays the full price.
# Otherwise Kate will contribute 1/3 of the price, but no more than €10 (she's broke :-) and Michael pays the rest.
# How much is Michael going to pay? Calculate the amount with two decimals, if necessary.

def michael_pays(cost):
    return round(cost if cost < 5 else max(cost * 2 / 3, cost - 10), 2)
