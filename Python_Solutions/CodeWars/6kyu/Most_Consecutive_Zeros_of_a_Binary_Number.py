# Given a string (str) containing a base-10 integer between 0 and 10000, convert the integer to its binary representation. At that point, obtain a count of the maximum amount of consecutive 0s. From there, return the count in written form with a capital letter.
#
# max_consec_zeros("9") => "Two"
# max_consec_zeros("13") => "One"
# max_consec_zeros("15") => "Zero"
# max_consec_zeros("42") => "One"
# max_consec_zeros("550") => "Three"
# In the very first example, we have an argument of "9" which is being passed to the method. The binary representation of 9 is 1001 which can be read as: one, zero, zero, one. There are, at most, two consecutive 0s, resulting in the integer 2 as the value of the count. The output in the block of code above reflects the final step of taking 2 from standard form to the written form "Two" as prompted.
#
# In the very last example, we have an argument of "550" which is being passed to the method. The binary representation of 550 is 1000100110 which can be read as: one, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, one, zero. There are, at most, three consecutive 0s, resulting in the integer 3 as the value of the count. The output in the block of code above reflects the final step of taking 3 from standard form to the written form of "Three" as prompted.

# One way, among many, to visualize the end of each step might look like:
#
# max_consec_zeros("777")
# 1: "777"
# 2: 777
# 3: 1100001001
# 4: 4
# 5: "Four"
# max_consec_zeros("777") => "Four"
# Happy coding!
