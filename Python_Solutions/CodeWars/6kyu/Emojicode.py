# In this challenge, you have to create two functions to convert an emoji string to the "emojicode" format, and back.
#
# Emoji strings consist solely of Unicode emojis, and each of the emojis can be represented with a single Unicode code point. There is no combining characters, variant selectors, joiners, direction modifiers, color modifiers, groups of people, or any other emojis which consist of more than a single code point.
#
# Emojicode string is a string of space separated code points of Unicode emojis. Every code point is formatted as its decimal value, stringified into a sequence of Unicode emoji keycap digits.
#
# Examples
# The emoji "SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES" üòä is encoded as U+1F60A. The decimal value of its code point is 128522. After converting the value to a string and using emoji keycaps for digits, the emojicode is "1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£".
#
# The three emojis SEE-/HEAR-/SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY are represented by code points U+1F648, U+1F649, and U+1F64A, which are decimal 128584, 128585 and 128586, respectively. Therefore, the string "üôàüôâüôä" after conversion to emojicode results in "1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£".

# Tests size
# At the moment of the writing, Unicode Emoji Standard includes ~1380 emojis which can be represented with a single Unicode code point (see References below). Each of these emojis is tested at least once for conversion in both directions, with fixed tests. Additionally, small random tests check 50 strings of 1-5 emojis and 200 strings of 20-50 emojis, for conversion in both directions.
