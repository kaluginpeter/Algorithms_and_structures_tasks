# Task
# A staircase is given with a non-negative cost per each step. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. Create a solution to find the minimum sum of costs to reach the top. You can start at either of the first two steps.
#
# Examples
# Stairs: [0, 2, 2, 1]
# Step 0: Start on first step
# Step 1: Pay 0 and climb two steps to reach the third step
# Step 2: Pay 2 and climb two steps to reach the top
# Total spent: 2
#
# Stairs: [0, 2, 3, 2]
# Step 0: Start on first step
# Step 1: Pay 0 and climb two steps to reach the third step
# Step 2: Pay 3 and climb two steps to reach the top
# Total spent: 3
#
# Stairs: [10, 15, 20]
# Step 0: Start on the second step
# Step 1: Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top
# Total spent: 15
#
# Stairs [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
# Take any path, because every step is free!
#
# Stairs [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
# Step 0: Start on the second step
# Step 1: Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach the fourth step
# Step 2: Pay 0 and climb one step to reach the fifth step
# Step 3: Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach the top
# Total spent: 2
# Notes
# 2 <= number of steps <= 1000
