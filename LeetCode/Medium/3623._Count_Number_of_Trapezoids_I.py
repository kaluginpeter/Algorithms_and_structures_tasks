# You are given a 2D integer array points, where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinates of the ith point on the Cartesian plane.
#
# A horizontal trapezoid is a convex quadrilateral with at least one pair of horizontal sides (i.e. parallel to the x-axis). Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.
#
# Return the number of unique horizontal trapezoids that can be formed by choosing any four distinct points from points.
#
# Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: points = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[2,2],[3,2]]
#
# Output: 3
#
# Explanation:
#
#
#
# There are three distinct ways to pick four points that form a horizontal trapezoid:
#
# Using points [1,0], [2,0], [3,2], and [2,2].
# Using points [2,0], [3,0], [3,2], and [2,2].
# Using points [1,0], [3,0], [3,2], and [2,2].
# Example 2:
#
# Input: points = [[0,0],[1,0],[0,1],[2,1]]
#
# Output: 1
#
# Explanation:
#
#
#
# There is only one horizontal trapezoid that can be formed.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 4 <= points.length <= 105
# –108 <= xi, yi <= 108
# All points are pairwise distinct.
# Solution
# Python O(N) O(D) Math
