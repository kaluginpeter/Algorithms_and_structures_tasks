# You like the way the Python + operator easily handles adding different numeric types, but you need a tool to do that kind of addition without killing your program with a TypeError exception whenever you accidentally try adding incompatible types like strings and lists to numbers.
#
# You decide to write a function my_add() that takes two arguments. If the arguments can be added together it returns the sum. If adding the arguments together would raise an error the function should return None instead.
#
# For example, my_add(1, 3.414) would return 4.414, but my_add(42, " is the answer.") would return None.
#
# Hint: using a try / except statement may simplify this kata.
