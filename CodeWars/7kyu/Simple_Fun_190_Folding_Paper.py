# Task
# John was in math class and got bored, so he decided to fold some origami from a rectangular a × b sheet of paper (a > b). His first step is to make a square piece of paper from the initial rectangular piece of paper by folding the sheet along the bisector of the right angle and cutting off the excess part.
#
# Folding
# After moving the square piece of paper aside, John wanted to make even more squares! He took the remaining (a-b) × b strip of paper and went on with the process until he was left with a square piece of paper.
#
# Your task is to determine how many square pieces of paper John can make.
#
# Example:
# For: a = 2, b = 1, the output should be 2.
#
# Given a = 2 and b = 1, John can fold a 1 × 1 then another 1 × 1.
#
# So the answer is 2.
#
# For: a = 10, b = 7, the output should be 6.
#
# We are given a = 10 and b = 7. The following is the order of squares John folds: 7 × 7, 3 × 3, 3 × 3, 1 × 1, 1 × 1, and 1 × 1.

# Here are pictures for the example cases.

# Resulting squares
# Input/Output
# [input] integer a
# 2 ≤ a ≤ 1000
#
# [input] integer b
# 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 1000
#
# [output] an integer
# The maximum number of squares.
