# It's Friday the 13th, and Jason is ready for his first killing spree!
#
# Create a function, killcount, that accepts two arguments: an array of array pairs (the conselor's name and intelligence - ["Chad", 2]) and an integer representing Jason's intellegence.
#
# Ruby, Python, Crystal:
#
# counselors = [["Chad", 2], ["Tommy", 9]]
# jason = 7
# JavaScript:
#
# var counselors = [["Chad", 2], ["Tommy", 9]];
# var jason = 7;
# PHP:
#
# $counselors = [["Chad", 2], ["Tommy", 9]];
# $jason = 7;
# Your function must return an array of the names of all the counselors who can be outsmarted and killed by Jason.
#
# Happy Friday the 13th!
