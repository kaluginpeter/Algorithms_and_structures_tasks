# The following code was thought to be working properly, however when the code tries to access the age of the person instance it fails.
#
# person = Person('Yukihiro', 'Matsumoto', 47)
# print(person.full_name)
# print(person.age)
# For this exercise you need to fix the code so that it works correctly.
#
# Note: the order of the person's full name is first name and last name.
