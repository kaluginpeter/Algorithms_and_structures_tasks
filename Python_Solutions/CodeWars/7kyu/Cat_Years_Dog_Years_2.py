# Kata Task
# I have a cat and a dog which I got as kitten / puppy.
#
# I forget when that was, but I do know their current ages as catYears and dogYears.
#
# Find how long I have owned each of my pets and return as a list [ownedCat, ownedDog]
#
# NOTES:
#
# Results are truncated whole numbers of "human" years
# Cat Years
# 15 cat years for first year
# +9 cat years for second year
# +4 cat years for each year after that
# Dog Years
# 15 dog years for first year
# +9 dog years for second year
