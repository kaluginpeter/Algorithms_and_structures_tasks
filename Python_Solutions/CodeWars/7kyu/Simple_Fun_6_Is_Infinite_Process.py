# Task
# Given integers a and b, determine whether the following pseudocode results in an infinite loop
#
#  while (a !== b){
#      a++
#      b--
#  }
# Assume that the program is executed on a virtual machine which can store arbitrary long numbers and execute forever.
#
# Example
# For a = 2 and b = 6, the output should be
#
# isInfiniteProcess(a, b) = false (or equivalent in PHP)
#
# For a = 2 and b = 3, the output should be
#
# isInfiniteProcess(a, b) = true (or equivalent in PHP)
#
# Input/Output
# [input] integer a
# Constraints: 0 ≤ a ≤ 100.
#
# [input] integer b
# Constraints: 0 ≤ b ≤ 100.
#
# [output] a boolean value
# true if the pseudocode will never stop, false otherwise.
