# Description
# Write a function that checks whether a credit card number is correct or not, using the Luhn algorithm.
#
# The algorithm is as follows:
#
# From the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, moving left, double the value of every second digit; if the product of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g., 8 × 2 = 16), then sum the digits of the products (e.g., 16: 1 + 6 = 7, 18: 1 + 8 = 9) or alternatively subtract 9 from the product (e.g., 16: 16 - 9 = 7, 18: 18 - 9 = 9).
# Take the sum of all the digits.
# If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero) then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; else it is not valid.
# The input is a string with the full credit card number, in groups of 4 digits separated by spaces, i.e. "1234 5678 9012 3456"
# Don´t worry about wrong inputs, they will always be a string with 4 groups of 4 digits each separated by space.
#
# Examples
# "5457 6238 9823 4311" --> True
#
# "5457 6238 9323 4311" --> False

def valid_card(card):
    x: int = 0
    digits: str = ''.join(reversed(card.split()))
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if (i & 1) == 0:
            y: int = int(digits[i]) * 2
            x += [y, y - 9][y > 9]
        else: x += int(digits[i])
    return x % 10 == 0
