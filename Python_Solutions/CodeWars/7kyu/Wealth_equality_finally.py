# The year is 2088 and the Radical Marxist Socialist People's Party (RMSPP) has just seized power in Brazil.
#
# Their first act in power is absolute wealth equality through coercive redistribution.
#
# Create a function that redistributes all wealth equally among all citizens.
#
# Wealth is represented as an array/list where every index is the wealth of a single citizen.
# The function should mutate the input such that every index has the same amount of wealth.
#
# See example:
#
# Input:
# [5, 10, 6]  >>> This represents:
#            # citizen 1 has wealth 5
#            # citizen 2 has wealth 10
#            # citizen 3 has wealth 6
# Should be after the test:
#  [7, 7, 7] >>> wealth has now been equally redistributed
# Info:
#
# MUTATE the input array/list, don't return anything
# Input is guaranteed to hold at least 1 citizen
# Wealth of a citizen will be an integer with minimum equal to 0 (negative wealth is not possible)
# Handling of floating point error will not be tested
