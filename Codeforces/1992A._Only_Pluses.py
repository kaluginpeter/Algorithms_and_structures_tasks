# Kmes has written three integers a
# , b
#  and c
#  in order to remember that he has to give Noobish_Monk a×b×c
#  bananas.
#
# Noobish_Monk has found these integers and decided to do the following at most 5
#  times:
#
# pick one of these integers;
# increase it by 1
# .
# For example, if a=2
# , b=3
#  and c=4
# , then one can increase a
#  three times by one and increase b
#  two times. After that a=5
# , b=5
# , c=4
# . Then the total number of bananas will be 5×5×4=100
# .
#
# What is the maximum value of a×b×c
#  Noobish_Monk can achieve with these operations?
#
# Input
# Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t
#  (1≤t≤1000
# ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
#
# The first and only line of each test case contains three integers a
# , b
#  and c
#  (1≤a,b,c≤10
# ) — Kmes's integers.
#
# Output
# For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum amount of bananas Noobish_Monk can get.
