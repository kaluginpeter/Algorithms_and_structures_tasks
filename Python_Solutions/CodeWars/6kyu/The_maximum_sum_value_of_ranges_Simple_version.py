# Description:
# For example:
#
#  Given arr = [1,-2,3,4,-5,-4,3,2,1],
#        range = [[1,3],[0,4],[6,8]]
#  should return 6
#
#  calculation process:
#  range[1,3] = arr[1]+arr[2]+arr[3] = 5
#  range[0,4] = arr[0]+arr[1]+arr[2]+arr[3]+arr[4] = 1
#  range[6,8] = arr[6]+arr[7]+arr[8] = 6
#  So the maximum sum value is 6
# Note:
# arr/$a always has at least 5 elements;
# range/$range/ranges always has at least 1 element;
# All inputs are valid;
# This is a simple version, if you want some challenge, please try the challenge version.
# Some Examples
#  maxSum([1,-2,3,4,-5,-4,3,2,1],[[1,3],[0,4],[6,8]]) === 6
#  maxSum([1,-2,3,4,-5,-4,3,2,1],[[1,3]]) === 5
#  maxSum([1,-2,3,4,-5,-4,3,2,1],[[1,4],[2,5]]) === 0
