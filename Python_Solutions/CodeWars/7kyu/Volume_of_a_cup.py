# Your job is to return the volume of a cup when given the diameter of the top, the diameter of the bottom and the height.
#
# You know that there is a steady gradient from the top to the bottom.
#
# You want to return the volume rounded to 2 decimal places.
#
# Exmples:
#
# cup_volume(1, 1, 1)==0.79
#
# cup_volume(10, 8, 10)==638.79
#
# cup_volume(1000, 1000, 1000)==785398163.4
#
# cup_volume(13.123, 123.12, 1)==4436.57
#
# cup_volume(5, 12, 31)==1858.51
# You will only be passed positive numbers.
