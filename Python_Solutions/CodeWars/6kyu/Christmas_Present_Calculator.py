# Christmas Present Calculator
# After we find out if Santa can save Christmas there is another task to face.
#
# Santa's little helper aren't sick anymore. They are ready to give away presents again. But some of them are still weak.
# This leads to more productive elves than others.
#
# How many presents can Santa distribute this christmas?
#
# Your Task:
# You will get two inputs.
# One dictionary with the producitivity of each elf like the following:
#
# {"Santa": 1, "elf_1": 1, "elf_2": 1, "elf_3": 2, "elf_4": 3}
#
# and a string array with the time needed for each present like the following:
#
# "hh:mm:ss"
#
# The productivity describes the workload an elf can do each day:
#
# //productivity 1 = 24 hours each day
# //productivity 2 = 48 hours each day
# ...
#
# Return the number of present they can distribute at maximum.
#
# Note that:
#
# They have only 24 hours
# They try to give out as much as presents as possible (the ones with less time first)
# All the elves can work on multiple tasks. You can count it as one work capacity
