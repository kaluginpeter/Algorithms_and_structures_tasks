# Task
# Given an array arr and a number n. Call a pair of numbers from the array a Perfect Pair if their sum is equal to n.
#
# Find all of the perfect pairs and return the sum of their indices.
#
# Note that any element of the array can only be counted in one Perfect Pair. Also if there are multiple correct answers, return the smallest one.
#
# Example
# For arr = [1, 4, 2, 3, 0, 5] and n = 7, the result should be 11.
#
# Since the Perfect Pairs are (4, 3) and (2, 5) with indices 1 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 11.
#
# For arr = [1, 3, 2, 4] and n = 4, the result should be 1.
#
# Since the element at index 0 (i.e. 1) and the element at index 1 (i.e. 3) form the only Perfect Pair.
#
# Input/Output
# [input] integer array arr
# array of non-negative integers.
#
# [input] integer n
# positive integer
#
# [output] integer
# sum of indices and 0 if no Perfect Pair exists.

# Solution
def pairwise(arr, n):
    c = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        i2 = n - arr[i]
        if i2 in arr[i+1:]:
            j = arr.index(i2, i+1)
            c += i + j
            arr[i] = arr[j] = n + 1
    return c
