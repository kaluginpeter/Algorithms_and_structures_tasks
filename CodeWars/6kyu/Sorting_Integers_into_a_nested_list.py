# Hi! Welcome to my first kata.
#
# In this kata the task is to take a list of integers (positive and negative) and split them according to a simple rule; those ints greater than or equal to the key, and those ints less than the key (the itself key will always be positive).
#
# However, in this kata the goal is to sort the numbers IN PLACE, so DON'T go messing around with the order in with the numbers appear.
#
# You are to return a nested list. If the list is empty, simply return an empty list.
#
# Confused? Okay, let me walk you through an example...
#
# The input is: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 10, 5, 10], the key is: 6
# Okay so the first five numbers are less than the key, 6, so we group them together.
#
# [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
# The next two numbers, 6 & 10, are both >= 6 to they belong in a seperate group, which we will add to the first group. Like so:
#
# [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [6, 10]]
# The next two numbers are 5 & 10. Since the key is 6 these two numbers form seperate groups, which we will add to the previous result. like so:
#
# [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [6, 10], [5], [10]]
# And voila! We're done.
#
# Here are a few more basic examples:
#
# group_ints([1, 0], key= 0)
# --> [[1,0]]
#
# group_ints([1, 0, -1, 5], key= 0)
# --> [[1, 0], [-1], [5]]
#
# group_ints([1, 0, -1, 5], key= 5)
# --> [[1, 0, -1], [5]]
# Good luck guys/gals!
