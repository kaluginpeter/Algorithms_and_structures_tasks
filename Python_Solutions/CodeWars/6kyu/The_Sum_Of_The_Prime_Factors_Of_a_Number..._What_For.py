# Every number may be factored in prime factors.
#
# For example, the number 18 may be factored by its prime factors 2 and 3
#
# 18 = 2 . 3 . 3 = 2 . 3Â²
# The sum of the prime factors of 18 is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8
#
# But some numbers like 70 are divisible by the sum of its prime factors:
#
# 70 = 2 . 5 . 7 # sum of prime factors = 2 + 5 + 7 = 14
# and 70 is a multiple of 14
# Of course that primes would fulfill this property, but is obvious, because the prime decomposition of a number, is the number itself and every number is divisible by iself. That is why we will discard every prime number in the results
#
# We are interested in collect the integer positive numbers (non primes) that have this property in a certain range [a, b] (inclusive).
#
# Make the function mult_primefactor_sum(), that receives the values a, b as limits of the range [a, b] and a < b and outputs the sorted list of these numbers.
#
# Let's see some cases:
#
# mult_primefactor_sum(10, 100) == [16, 27, 30, 60, 70, 72, 84]
#
# mult_primefactor_sum(1, 60) == [1, 4, 16, 27, 30, 60]
