# Create a function longer that accepts a string and sorts the words
# in it based on their respective lengths in an ascending order.
# If there are two words of the same lengths, sort them alphabetically. Look at the examples below for more details.
#
# longer("Another Green World") => Green World Another
# longer("Darkness on the edge of Town") => of on the Town edge Darkness
# longer("Have you ever Seen the Rain") => the you Have Rain Seen ever
# Assume that only only Alphabets will be entered as the input. Uppercase
# characters have priority over lowercase characters. That is,
#
# longer("hello Hello") => Hello hello
