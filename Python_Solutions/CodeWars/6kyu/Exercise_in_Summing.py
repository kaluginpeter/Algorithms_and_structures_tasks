# Your task is to finish two functions, minimumSum and maximumSum, that take 2 parameters:
#
# values: an array of integers with an arbitrary length; may be positive and negative
# n: how many integers should be summed; always 0 or bigger
# Example:
# values = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];
# minimum_sum(values, 2) #should return 1 + 2 = 3
# maximum_sum(values, 3) #should return 3 + 4 + 5 = 12
# All values given to the functions will be integers. Also take care of the following special cases:
#
# if values is empty, both functions should return 0
# if n is 0, both functions should also return 0
# if n is larger than values's length, use the length instead.
