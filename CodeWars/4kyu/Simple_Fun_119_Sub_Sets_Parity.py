# Task
# You are given integer n determining set S = { 1, 2, .. n }. Determine if the number of k-element subsets of S is ODD or EVEN for given integer k.
#
# Example
# For n = 3, k = 2, the result should be "ODD"
#
# In this case, we have 3 2-element subsets of {1, 2, 3}:
#
# {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}
#
# For n = 2, k = 1, the result should be "EVEN".
#
# In this case, we have 2 1-element subsets of {1, 2}:
#
# {1}, {2}
#
# Don't bother with naive solution - numbers here are really big.
#
# Input/Output
# [input] integer n
#
# 1 <= n <= 10^9
#
# [input] integer k
#
# 1 <= k <= n
#
# [output] a string
#
# "EVEN" or "ODD" depending if the number of k-element subsets of S = {1, 2, ..., n} is ODD or EVEN.
#
