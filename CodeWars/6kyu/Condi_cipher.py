# Introduction
# The Condi (Consecutive Digraphs) cipher was introduced by G4EGG (Wilfred Higginson) in 2011.
# The cipher preserves word divisions, and is simple to describe and encode, but it's surprisingly difficult to crack.
#
# Encoding Algorithm
# The encoding steps are:
#
# Start with an initial key, e.g. cryptogram
# Form a key, remove the key duplicated letters except for the first occurrence
# Append to it, in alphabetical order all letters which do not occur in the key.
# The example produces: cryptogambdefhijklnqsuvwxz
# Number the key alphabet starting with 1.
# 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13
# c  r  y  p  t  o  g  a  m  b  d  e  f
# 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
# h  i  j  k  l  n  q  s  u  v  w  x  z
# One of the inputs to encoding algorithm is an initial shift, say 10
# Encode the first letter of your message by moving 10 places to the right from the letter's
# position in the key alphabet. If the first letter were say o then the letter 10 places to the
# right in the key alphabet is j, so o would be encoded as j. If you move past the end of the key
# alphabet you wrap back to the beginning. For example if the first letter were s then counting 10
# places would bring you around to t.
# Use the position of the previous plaintext letter as the number of places to move to encode
# the next plaintext number. If you have just encoded an o (position 6) , and you now want to
# encode say n, then you move 6 places to the right from n which brings you to x.
# Keep repeating the previous step until all letters are encoded.
# Decoding is the reverse of encoding - you move to the left instead of to the right.
#
# Task
# Create two functions - encode/Encode and decode/Decode which implement Condi cipher encoding and decoding.
#
# Inputs
# message - a string to encode/decode
# key - a key consists of only lower case letters
# initShift - a non-negative integer representing the initial shift
# Notes
# Don't forget to remove the duplicated letters from the key except for the first occurrence
# Characters which do not exist in the key alphabet should be coppied to the output string exactly like
# they appear in the message string
# Check the test cases for samples

def encode(message, key, shift, encode=True):
    LOWER = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    key = sorted(LOWER, key=f"{key}{LOWER}".index)
    l = []
    for j in message:
        if j in key:
            i = key.index(j)
            j = key[(i + shift) % 26]
            shift = i + 1 if encode else -(key.index(j) + 1)
        l.append(j)
    return "".join(l)


def decode(message, key, shift):
    return encode(message, key, -shift, encode=False)
