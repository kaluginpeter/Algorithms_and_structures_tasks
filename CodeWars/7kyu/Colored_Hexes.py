# You're looking through different hex codes, and having trouble telling the difference between #000001 and #100000
#
# We need a way to tell which is red, and which is blue!
#
# That's where you create hex color !!!
#
# It should read an RGB input, and return whichever value (red, blue, or green) is of greatest concentration!
#
# But, if multiple colors are of equal concentration, you should return their mix!
#
# red + blue = magenta
#
# green + red = yellow
#
# blue + green = cyan
#
# red + blue + green = white
# One last thing, if the string given is empty, or has all 0's, return black!
#
# Examples:
#
# codes = "087 255 054" -> "green"
# codes = "181 181 170" -> "yellow"
# codes = "000 000 000" -> "black"
# codes = "001 001 001" -> "white"
