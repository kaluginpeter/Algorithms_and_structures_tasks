# Lyrics
# 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
# Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
#
# 98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
# Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.
#
# ...and so on...
#
# 3 bottles of beer on the wall, 3 bottles of beer.
# Take one down and pass it around, 2 bottles of beer on the wall.
#
# 2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
# Take one down and pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.
#
# 1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
# Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.
#
# No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
# Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
