# Task:
# Based on the received dimensions, a and b, of an ellipse, calculare its area and perimeter.
#
# Example:
# Input: ellipse(5,2)
#
# Output: "Area: 31.4, perimeter: 23.1"
# Note: The perimeter approximation formula you should use: Ï€ * (3/2(a+b) - sqrt(ab))
#
# Have fun :)
# FUNDAMENTALS
# Solution
from math import pi
def ellipse(a, b):
    return f'Area: {round(pi * a * b, 1)}, perimeter: {round(pi * (3 / 2 * (a + b) - (a * b)**.5), 1)}'
