# A. Polycarp and the Day of Pi
# time limit per test1 second
# memory limit per test256 megabytes
# On March 14, the day of the number π
#  is celebrated all over the world. This is a very important mathematical constant equal to the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.
#
# Polycarp was told at school that the number π
#  is irrational, therefore it has an infinite number of digits in decimal notation. He wanted to prepare for the Day of the number π
#  by memorizing this number as accurately as possible.
#
# Polycarp wrote out all the digits that he managed to remember. For example, if Polycarp remembered π
#  as 3.1415
# , he wrote out 31415.
#
# Polycarp was in a hurry and could have made a mistake, so you decided to check how many first digits of the number π
#  Polycarp actually remembers correctly.
#
# Input
# The first line of the input data contains the single integer t
#  (1≤t≤103
# ) — the number of test cases in the test.
#
# Each test case is described by a single string of digits n
# , which was written out by Polycarp.
#
# The string n
#  contains up to 30
#  digits.
#
# Output
# Output t
#  integers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case, that is how many first digits of the number π
#  Polycarp remembers correctly.
