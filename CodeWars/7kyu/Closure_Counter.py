# Closure Counter
# Define the function counter that returns a function that returns an increasing value.
# The first value should be 1.
# You're going to have to use closures.
# Example:
# const newCounter = counter();
# newCounter() // 1
# newCounter() // 2
# Closure:
# A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
