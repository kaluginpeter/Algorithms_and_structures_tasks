# The prime factorization of a positive integer is a list of the integer's prime factors, together with their multiplicities; the process of determining these factors is called integer factorization. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic says that every positive integer has a single unique prime factorization.
#
# The prime factorization of 24, for instance, is (2^3) * (3^1).
#
# Write a class called PrimeFactorizer (inheriting directly from object) whose constructor accepts exactly 1 int and has a property factor containing a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are the multiplicities.
#
# PrimeFactorizer(24).factor #should return { 2: 3, 3: 1 }
