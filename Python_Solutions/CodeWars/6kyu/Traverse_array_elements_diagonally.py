# In this kata you're given an n x n array and you're expected to traverse the elements diagonally from the bottom right to the top left.
#
# Example
#   1 6 7
#   7 2 4
#   3 5 9
# your solution should return elements in the following order
#
# 9
# 4 5
# 7 2 3
# 6 7
# 1
# //=> [9, 4, 5, 7, 2, 3, 6, 7, 1]
#
# Your task is to write the function diagonal() that returns the array elements in the above manner.
#
# Another Example
# arr = [
#  [4, 5, 7],
#  [3, 9, 1],
#  [7, 6, 2]
# ]
#
# diagonal(arr) //=> [2, 1, 6, 7, 9, 7, 5, 3, 4]
# You can assume the test cases are well formed.
