# B. Different String
# time limit per test1 second
# memory limit per test256 megabytes
# You are given a string s
#  consisting of lowercase English letters.
#
# Rearrange the characters of s
#  to form a new string r
#  that is not equal to s
# , or report that it's impossible.
#
# Input
# The first line contains a single integer t
#  (1≤t≤1000
# ) — the number of test cases.
#
# The only line of each test case contains a string s
#  of length at most 10
#  consisting of lowercase English letters.
#
# Output
# For each test case, if no such string r
#  exists as described in the statement, output "NO" (without quotes).
#
# Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
# , consisting of letters of string s
# .
#
# You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).
#
# If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.
#

# NO
# YES
# xxyxx
# YES
# oc
# NO
# YES
# undertale
# YES
# thtsiwm
# NO
# Note
# In the first test case, another possible answer is forcescode
# .
#
# In the second test case, all rearrangements of aaaaa
#  are equal to aaaaa
