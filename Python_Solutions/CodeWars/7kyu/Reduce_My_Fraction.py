# Write a function which reduces fractions to their simplest form! Fractions will be presented as an array/tuple (depending on the language) of strictly positive integers, and the reduced fraction must be returned as an array/tuple:
#
# input:   [numerator, denominator]
# output:  [reduced numerator, reduced denominator]
# example: [45, 120] --> [3, 8]
# All numerators and denominators will be positive integers.
