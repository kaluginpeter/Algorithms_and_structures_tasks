# You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays player1 and player2,
# that represent the number of pins that player 1 and player 2 hit in a bowling game, respectively.
# The bowling game consists of n turns, and the number of pins in each turn is exactly 10.
# Assume a player hit xi pins in the ith turn. The value of the ith turn for the player is:
# 2xi if the player hit 10 pins in any of the previous two turns.
# Otherwise, It is xi.
# The score of the player is the sum of the values of their n turns.
#
# Return
#
# 1 if the score of player 1 is more than the score of player 2,
# 2 if the score of player 2 is more than the score of player 1, and
# 0 in case of a draw.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: player1 = [4,10,7,9], player2 = [6,5,2,3]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The score of player1 is 4 + 10 + 2*7 + 2*9 = 46.
# The score of player2 is 6 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 16.
# Score of player1 is more than the score of player2, so, player1 is the winner, and the answer is 1.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: player1 = [3,5,7,6], player2 = [8,10,10,2]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The score of player1 is 3 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 21.
# The score of player2 is 8 + 10 + 2*10 + 2*2 = 42.
# Score of player2 is more than the score of player1, so, player2 is the winner, and the answer is 2.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: player1 = [2,3], player2 = [4,1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The score of player1 is 2 + 3 = 5
# The score of player2 is 4 + 1 = 5
# The score of player1 equals to the score of player2, so, there is a draw, and the answer is 0.
#
# Constraints:
# n == player1.length == player2.length
# 1 <= n <= 1000
# 0 <= player1[i], player2[i] <= 10
# Solution
