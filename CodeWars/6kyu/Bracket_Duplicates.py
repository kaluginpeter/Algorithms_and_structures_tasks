# Create a program that will take in a string as input and, if there are duplicates of more than two alphabetical characters in the string, returns the string with all the extra characters in a bracket.
#
# For example, the input "aaaabbcdefffffffg" should return "aa[aa]bbcdeff[fffff]g"
#
# Please also ensure that the input is a string, and return "Please enter a valid string" if it is not.
