# Given two arrays, the purpose of this Kata is to check if these two arrays are the same. "The same" in this Kata means the two arrays contains arrays of 2 numbers which are same and not necessarily sorted the same way. i.e. [[2,5], [3,6]] is same as [[5,2], [3,6]] or [[6,3], [5,2]] or [[6,3], [2,5]] etc
#
# [[2,5], [3,6]] is NOT the same as [[2,3], [5,6]]
# Two empty arrays [] are the same
# [[2,5], [5,2]] is the same as [[2,5], [2,5]] but NOT the same as [[2,5]]
# [[2,5], [3,5], [6,2]] is the same as [[2,6], [5,3], [2,5]] or [[3,5], [6,2], [5,2]], etc
# An array can be empty or contain a minimun of one array of 2 integers and up to 100 array of 2 integers
# Note:
#
# [[]] is not applicable because if the array of array are to contain anything, there have to be two numbers.
# 100 randomly generated tests that can contains either "s
