# You are given a list of directions in the form of a list:
#
# goal = ["N", "S", "E", "W"]
#
# Pretend that each direction counts for 1 step in that particular direction.
#
# Your task is to create a function called directions, that will return a reduced list that will get you to the same point.The order of directions must be returned as N then S then E then W.
#
# If you get back to beginning, return an empty array.
