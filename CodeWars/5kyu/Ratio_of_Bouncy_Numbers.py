# Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.
#
# Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, 66420.
#
# We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a "bouncy" number; for example, 155349.
#
# Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just over half of the numbers below one-thousand (525) are bouncy. In fact, the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first reaches 50% is 538.
#
# Surprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time we reach 21780 the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to 90%.
#
# Your Task
# Complete the bouncyRatio function.
#
# The input will be the target ratio.
#
# The output should be the smallest number such that the proportion of bouncy numbers reaches the target ratio.
#
# You should throw an Error for a ratio less than 0% or greater than 99%.
