# Given an integer, take the (mean) average of each pair of consecutive digits. Repeat this process until you have a single integer, then return that integer. e.g.
#
# Note: if the average of two digits is not an integer, round the result up (e.g. the average of 8 and 9 will be 9)
#
# Examples
# digitsAverage(246)  ==>  4
#
# original: 2   4   6
#            \ / \ /
# 1st iter:   3   5
#              \ /
# 2nd iter:     4
#
#
# digitsAverage(89)  ==>  9
#
# original: 8   9
#            \ /
# 1st iter:   9
