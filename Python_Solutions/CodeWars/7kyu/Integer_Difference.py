# Write a function that accepts two arguments: an array/list of integers and another integer (n).
#
# Determine the number of times where two integers in the array have a difference of n.
#
# For example:
#
# [1, 1, 5, 6, 9, 16, 27], n=4  -->  3  # (1,5), (1,5), (5,9)
# [1, 1, 3, 3], n=2             -->  4  # (1,3), (1,3), (1,3), (1,3)
