# Write a function groupIn10s which takes any number of arguments,
# groups them into tens, and sorts each group in ascending order.
#
# The return value should be an array of arrays, so that numbers between
# 0 and9 inclusive are in position 0, numbers between 10 and 19 are in position 1, etc.
#
# Here's an example of the required output:
#
# grouped = group_in_10s(8, 12, 38, 3, 17, 19, 25, 35, 50)
#
# grouped[0]     # [3, 8]
# grouped[1]     # [12, 17, 19]
# grouped[2]     # [25]
# grouped[3]     # [35, 38]
# grouped[4]     # None
# grouped[5]     # [50]
