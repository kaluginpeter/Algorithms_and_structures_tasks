# Luke Skywalker gave Chewbacca an integer number x. Chewbacca isn't good at numbers but he loves inverting digits in them. Inverting digit t means replacing it with digit 9 - t.
#
# Help Chewbacca to transform the initial number x to the minimum possible positive number by inverting some (possibly, zero) digits. The decimal representation of the final number shouldn't start with a zero.
#
# Input
# The first line contains a single integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1018) — the number that Luke Skywalker gave to Chewbacca.
#
# Output
# Print the minimum possible positive number that Chewbacca can obtain after inverting some digits. The number shouldn't contain leading zeroes.
