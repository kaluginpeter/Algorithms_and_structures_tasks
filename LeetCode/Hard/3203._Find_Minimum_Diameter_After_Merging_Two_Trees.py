# There exist two undirected trees with n and m nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1 and from 0 to m - 1, respectively. You are given two 2D integer arrays edges1 and edges2 of lengths n - 1 and m - 1, respectively, where edges1[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the first tree and edges2[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi in the second tree.
#
# You must connect one node from the first tree with another node from the second tree with an edge.
#
# Return the minimum possible diameter of the resulting tree.
#
# The diameter of a tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]], edges2 = [[0,1]]
#
# Output: 3
#
# Explanation:
#
# We can obtain a tree of diameter 3 by connecting node 0 from the first tree with any node from the second tree.
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4],[2,5],[3,6],[2,7]], edges2 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4],[2,5],[3,6],[2,7]]
#
# Output: 5
#
# Explanation:
#
# We can obtain a tree of diameter 5 by connecting node 0 from the first tree with node 0 from the second tree.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= n, m <= 105
# edges1.length == n - 1
# edges2.length == m - 1
# edges1[i].length == edges2[i].length == 2
# edges1[i] = [ai, bi]
# 0 <= ai, bi < n
# edges2[i] = [ui, vi]
# 0 <= ui, vi < m
# The input is generated such that edges1 and edges2 represent valid trees.
