# A. Required Remainder

# You are given three integers x,y
#  and n
# . Your task is to find the maximum integer k
#  such that 0≤k≤n
#  that kmodx=y
# , where mod
#  is modulo operation. Many programming languages use percent operator % to implement it.
#
# In other words, with given x,y
#  and n
#  you need to find the maximum possible integer from 0
#  to n
#  that has the remainder y
#  modulo x
# .
#
# You have to answer t
#  independent test cases. It is guaranteed that such k
#  exists for each test case.
#
# Input
# The first line of the input contains one integer t
#  (1≤t≤5⋅104
# ) — the number of test cases. The next t
#  lines contain test cases.
#
# The only line of the test case contains three integers x,y
#  and n
#  (2≤x≤109; 0≤y<x; y≤n≤109
# ).
#
# It can be shown that such k
#  always exists under the given constraints.
#
# Output
# For each test case, print the answer — maximum non-negative integer k
#  such that 0≤k≤n
#  and kmodx=y
# . It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.

# Note
# In the first test case of the example, the answer is 12339=7⋅1762+5
#  (thus, 12339mod7=5
# ). It is obvious that there is no greater integer not exceeding 12345
#  which has the remainder 5
#  modulo 7
