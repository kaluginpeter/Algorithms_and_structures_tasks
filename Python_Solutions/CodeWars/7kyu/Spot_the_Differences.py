# This kata is part of the collection Mary's Puzzle Books.
#
# Mary brought home a "spot the differences" book. The book is full of a bunch of problems, and each problem consists of two strings that are similar. However, in each string there are a few characters that are different. An example puzzle from her book is:
#
# String 1: "abcdefg"
# String 2: "abcqetg"
# Notice how the "d" from String 1 has become a "q" in String 2, and "f" from String 1 has become a "t" in String 2.
#
# It's your job to help Mary solve the puzzles. Write a program spot_diff/Spot that will compare the two strings and return a list with the positions where the two strings differ. In the example above, your program should return [3, 5] because String 1 is different from String 2 at positions 3 and 5.
#
# NOTES:
#
# • If both strings are the same, return []
#
# • Both strings will always be the same length
#
# • Capitalization and punctuation matter
