# Story
# Carol's boss Bob thinks he is very smart. He says he made an app which
# renders messages unreadable without changing any letters, only by adding
# some new ones, while preserving message integrity (i. e. the original message can still be retrieved).
#
# He gave some limited access to his app to Carol to challenge her, and hinted that
# if Carol cannot crack this simple task, she might be fired.
#
# Carol was trying to crack this code herself, but got too tired, so she came to you
# for help. However, she succeeded to hack Bob's app and found a data field called 'marker'.
# She thinks it can be helpful for cracking Bob's app.
#
# Help Carol keep her job!
