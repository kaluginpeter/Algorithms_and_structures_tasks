# Write a function which will accept a sequence of numbers and calculate the variance for the sequence.
#
# The variance for a set of numbers is found by subtracting the mean from every value, squaring the results, adding them all up and dividing by the number of elements.
#
# For example, in pseudo code, to calculate the variance for [1, 2, 2, 3].
#
# mean = (1 + 2 + 2 + 3) / 4
# => 2
#
# variance = ((1 - 2)^2 + (2 - 2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (3 - 2)^2)  /  4
# => 0.5
# Results are tested to a relative error of 1e-4.
