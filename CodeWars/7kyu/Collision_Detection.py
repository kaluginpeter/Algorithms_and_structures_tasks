# Create a function to determine whether or not two circles are colliding. You will be given the position of both circles in addition to their radii:
#
# def collision(x1, y1, radius1, x2, y2, radius2):
#   # collision?
# If a collision is detected, return true. If not, return false.
#
# Here's a geometric diagram of what the circles passed in represent:
