# When we have a 2x2 square matrix we may have up to 24 different ones changing the positions of the elements.
#
# We show some of them
#
# a  b   a  b    a  c    a  c   a  d    a  d    b  a    b  a
# c  d   d  c    d  b    b  d   b  c    c  b    c  d    d  c
# You may think to generate the remaining ones until completing the set of 24 matrices.
#
# Given a certain matrix of numbers, that may be repeated or not, calculate the total number of possible matrices that may be generated, changing the position of the elements.
#
# E.g: Case one
#
# A = [[1,2,3],
#      [3,4,5]]   #a 2x3 rectangle matrix with number 3 twice
# generates a set of 360 different matrices
#
# Case two
#
# A = [[1,1,1],
#      [2,2,3],
#      [3,3,3]]
# generates a set of 1260 different matrices.
#
# Case three
#
# A = [[1,2,3],
#      [4,5,6],
#      [7,8,9]]
# generates a set of 362880 different matrices
#
# This kata is not meant to apply a brute force algorithm to try to count the total amount of marices.
