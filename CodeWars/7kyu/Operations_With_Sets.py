# We need a function that receives two arrays, each of them with elements that occur only once. We need to know:
#
# Number of elements that are present in both arrays
# Number of elements that are present in only one array
# Number of remaining elements in arr1 after extracting the elements of arr2
# Number of remaining elements in arr2 after extracting the elements of arr1
# Example
# arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
# The result is: [4, 8, 5, 3]
#
# 4 elements present in both arrays: 2, 4, 6, 8
# 8 elements present in only one array: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14
# 5 elements remaning in arr1: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
# 3 elements remaning in arr2: 10, 12, 14
# No doubt, an easy kata to warm up before doing the more complex ones. Enjoy it!
