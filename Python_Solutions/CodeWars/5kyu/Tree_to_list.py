# Given the root of a tree with an arbitrary number of child nodes, return a list containing the nodes' data in breadth-first order (left to right, top to bottom).
#
# Child nodes are stored in a list. An empty tree is represented by an empty list.
#
# Example:
#
#            1
#           / \
#          2   3  -> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
#         /|\   \
#        4 5 6   7
