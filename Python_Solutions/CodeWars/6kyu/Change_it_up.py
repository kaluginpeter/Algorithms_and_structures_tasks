# Create a function that takes a string as a parameter and does the following, in this order:
#
# Replaces every letter with the letter following it in the alphabet (see note below)
# Makes any vowels capital
# Makes any consonants lower case
# Note:
#
# the alphabet should wrap around, so Z becomes A
# in this kata, y isn't considered as a vowel.
# So, for example the string "Cat30" would return "dbU30" (Cat30 --> Dbu30 --> dbU30)
