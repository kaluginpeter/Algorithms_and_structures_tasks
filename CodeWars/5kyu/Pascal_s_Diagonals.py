# Create a function that returns an array containing the first l numbers from the nth diagonal of Pascal's triangle.
#
# n = 0 should generate the first diagonal of the triangle (the ones).
# The first number in each diagonal should be 1.
# If l = 0, return an empty array.
# Both n and l will be non-negative integers in all test cases.
