# You are given an expression of the form a+b
# , where a
#  and b
#  are integers from 0
#  to 9
# . You have to evaluate it and print the result.
#
# Input
# The first line contains one integer t
#  (1≤t≤100
# ) — the number of test cases.
#
# Each test case consists of one line containing an expression of the form a+b
#  (0≤a,b≤9
# , both a
#  and b
#  are integers). The integers are not separated from the +
#  sign.
#
# Output
# For each test case, print one integer — the result of the expression.
