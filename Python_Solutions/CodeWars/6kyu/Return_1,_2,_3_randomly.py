# You have to create a function namedone_two (oneTwo for Java or Preloaded.
# OneTwo for C#) that returns 1 or 2 with equal probabilities. one_two is
# already defined in a global scope and can be called everywhere.
#
# Your goal is to create a function named one_two_three (oneTwoThree for Java
# or OneTwoThree for C#) that returns 1, 2 or 3 with equal probabilities using only the one_two function.
#
# Do not try to cheat returning repeating non-random sequences. There is a randomness test especially for this case.
