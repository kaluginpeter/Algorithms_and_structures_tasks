# You have been employed by the Japanese government to write a function that tests whether or not a building is strong enough to withstand a simulated earthquake.
#
# A building will fall if the magnitude of the earthquake is greater than the strength of the building.
#
# An earthquake takes the form of a 2D-Array. Each element within the Outer-Array represents a shockwave, and each element within the Inner-Arrays represents a tremor. The magnitude of the earthquake is determined by the product of the values of its shockwaves. A shockwave is equal to the sum of the values of its tremors.
#
# Example earthquake --> [[5,3,7],[3,3,1],[4,1,2]] ((5+3+7) * (3+3+1) * (4+1+2)) = 735
#
# A building begins with a strength value of 1000 when first built, but this value is subject to exponential decay of 1% per year. For more info on exponential decay, follow this link - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay
#
# Given an earthquake and the age of a building, write a function that returns "Safe!" if the building is strong enough, or "Needs Reinforcement!" if it falls.

def strong_enough(earthquake, age):
    strength = 1000 * 0.99 ** age
    shockwave = reduce(lambda x, y: x*y, [sum(i) for i in earthquake])
    return "Needs Reinforcement!" if strength <= shockwave else "Safe!"
