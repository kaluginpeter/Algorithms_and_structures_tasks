# Backstory
#
# To celebrate today's launch of my Hero's new book: Alan Partridge: Nomad, We have a new series of kata arranged around the great man himself.
#
# Task
# Given an array of terms, if any of those terms relate to Alan Partridge, return Mine's a Pint!
#
# The number of exclamation mark (!) after the t should be determined by the number of Alan related terms you find in the given array (x). The related terms are as follows:
#
# Partridge
# PearTree
# Chat
# Dan
# Toblerone
# Lynn
# AlphaPapa
# Nomad
# If you don't find any related terms, return Lynn, I've pierced my foot on a spike!!
