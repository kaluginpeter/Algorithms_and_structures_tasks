# Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.
#
# The distance between two cells sharing a common edge is 1.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
# Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
# Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# m == mat.length
# n == mat[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 104
# 1 <= m * n <= 104
# mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
# There is at least one 0 in mat.
