# Given an integer num, return a string representing its hexadecimal representation.
# For negative integers, twoâ€™s complement method is used.
# All the letters in the answer string should be lowercase characters,
# and there should not be any leading zeros in the answer except for the zero itself.
# Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in library method to directly solve this problem.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: num = 26
# Output: "1a"
# Example 2:
#
# Input: num = -1
# Output: "ffffffff"
#
# Constraints:
# -231 <= num <= 231 - 1
# Solution
