# Mr. Khalkhoul, an amazing teacher, likes to answer questions sent by his students via e-mail,
# but he often doesn't have the time to answer all of them. In this kata you will help him by making a
# program that finds some of the answers.
#
# You are given a question which is a string containing the question and some information which is a list
# of strings representing potential answers.
#
# Your task is to find among information the UNIQUE string that has the highest number of words in common
# with question. We shall consider words to be separated by a single space.
#
# You can assume that:
#
# all strings given contain at least one word and have no leading or trailing spaces,
# words are composed with alphanumeric characters only
# You must also consider the case in which you get no matching words (again, ignoring the case):
# in such a case return None/nil/null.
#
# Mr. Khalkhoul is countin' on you :)

def answer(question, information):
    c, s = max((sum(j in i.lower().split() for j in question.lower().split()), i) for i in information)
    return None if not c else s
