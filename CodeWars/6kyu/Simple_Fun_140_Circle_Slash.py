# Task
# Suppose there are n people standing in a circle and they are numbered 1 through n in order.
#
# Person 1 starts off with a sword and kills person 2. He then passes the sword to the next person still standing, in this case person 3. Person 3 then uses the sword to kill person 4, and passes it to person 5. This pattern continues around and around the circle until just one person remains.
#
# What is the number of this person?
#
# Example:
# For n = 5, the result should be 3.
#
# 1 kills 2, passes to 3.
# 3 kills 4, passes to 5.
# 5 kills 1, passes to 3.
# 3 kills 5 and wins.
# Input/Output
# [input] integer n
# The number of people. 1 through n standing in a circle.
#
# 1 <= n <= 1e9
#
# [output] an integer
# The index of the last person standing.
