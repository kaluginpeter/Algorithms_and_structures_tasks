# For the New Year, Polycarp decided to send postcards to all his n
#  friends. He wants to make postcards with his own hands. For this purpose, he has a sheet of paper of size w×h
# , which can be cut into pieces.
#
# Polycarp can cut any sheet of paper w×h
#  that he has in only two cases:
#
# If w
#  is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size w2×h
# ;
# If h
#  is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size w×h2
# ;
# If w
#  and h
#  are even at the same time, then Polycarp can cut the sheet according to any of the rules above.
#
# After cutting a sheet of paper, the total number of sheets of paper is increased by 1
# .
#
# Help Polycarp to find out if he can cut his sheet of size w×h
#  at into n
#  or more pieces, using only the rules described above.
#
# Input
# The first line contains one integer t
#  (1≤t≤104
# ) — the number of test cases. Then t
#  test cases follow.
#
# Each test case consists of one line containing three integers w
# , h
# , n
#  (1≤w,h≤104,1≤n≤109
# ) — the width and height of the sheet Polycarp has and the number of friends he needs to send a postcard to.
#
# Output
# For each test case, output on a separate line:
#
# "YES", if it is possible to cut a sheet of size w×h
#  into at least n
#  pieces;
# "NO" otherwise.
# You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).

# YES
# Note
# In the first test case, you can first cut the 2×2
#  sheet into two 2×1
#  sheets, and then cut each of them into two more sheets. As a result, we get four sheets 1×1
# . We can choose any three of them and send them to our friends.
#
# In the second test case, a 3×3
#  sheet cannot be cut, so it is impossible to get two sheets.
#
# In the third test case, you can cut a 5×10
#  sheet into two 5×5
#  sheets.
#
# In the fourth test case, there is no need to cut the sheet, since we only need one sheet.
#
# In the fifth test case, you can first cut the 1×4
#  sheet into two 1×2
#  sheets, and then cut each of them into two more sheets. As a result, we get four sheets 1×1
# .
