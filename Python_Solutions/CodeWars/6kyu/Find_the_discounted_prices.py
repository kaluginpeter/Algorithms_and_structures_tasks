# Your friend Cody has to sell a lot of jam, so he applied a good 25% discount to all his merchandise.
#
# Trouble is that he mixed all the prices (initial and discounted), so now he needs
# your cool coding skills to filter out only the discounted prices.
#
# For example, consider this inputs:
#
# "15 20 60 75 80 100"
# "9 9 12 12 12 15 16 20"
# They should output:
#
# "15 60 75"
# "9 9 12 15"
# Every input will always have all the prices in pairs (initial and discounted) sorted from smaller to bigger.
#
# You might have noticed that the second sample input can be tricky already; also, try to have an eye
# for performances, as huge inputs could be tested too.
#
# Final Note: kata blatantly taken from this problem (and still not getting why they created a separated
# Code Jam for ladies, as I find it rather discriminating...).

    return ' '.join(l.remove(round(i*4/3)) or str(i) for i in l)
