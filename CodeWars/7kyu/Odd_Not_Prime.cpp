/*
For "x", determine how many positive integers less than or equal to "x" are odd but not prime. Assume "x" is an integer between 1 and 10000.

Example: 5 has three odd numbers (1,3,5) and only the number 1 is not prime, so the answer is 1

Example: 10 has five odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9) and only 1 and 9 are not prime, so the answer is 2
