# The galactic games have begun!
# It's the galactic games! Beings of all worlds come together to compete in several
# interesting sports, like nroogring, fredling and buzzing (the beefolks love the last one).
# However, there's also the traditional marathon run.
#
# Unfortunately, there have been cheaters in the last years, and the committee decided to
# place sensors on the track. Committees being committees, they've come up with the following rule:
#
# A sensor should be placed every 3 and 5 meters from the start, e.g. at 3m, 5m, 6m, 9m, 10m, 12m, 15m, 18mâ€¦.
#
# Since you're responsible for the track, you need to buy those sensors. Even worse, you don't know how
# long the track will be! And since there might be more than a single track, and you can't be
# bothered to do all of this by hand, you decide to write a program instead.
#
# Task
# Return the sum of the multiples of 3 and 5 below a number. Being the galactic games, the
# tracks can get rather large, so your solution should work for really large numbers (greater than 1,000,000).
#
# Examples
# solution (10) # => 23 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9
# solution (20) # => 78 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18

# Solution
def solution(number):
    a, b, c = (number - 1) // 5, (number - 1) // 3, (number - 1) // 15
    return (((a * (a + 1)) // 2) * 5) + (((b * (b + 1)) // 2) * 3) - (((c * (c + 1)) // 2) * 15)
