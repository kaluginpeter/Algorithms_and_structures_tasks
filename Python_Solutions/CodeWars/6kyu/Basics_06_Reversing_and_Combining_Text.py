# Your task is to Reverse and Combine Words. It's not too difficult, but there are some things you have to consider...
#
# So what to do?
# Input: String containing different "words" separated by spaces
#
# 1. More than one word? Reverse each word and combine first with second, third with fourth and so on...
#    (odd number of words => last one stays alone, but has to be reversed too)
# 2. Start it again until there's only one word without spaces
# 3. Return your result...
# Some easy examples:
# Input:  "abc def"
# Output: "cbafed"
#
# Input:  "abc def ghi 123"
# Output: "defabc123ghi"
#
# Input:  "abc def gh34 434ff 55_eri 123 343"
# Output: "43hgff434cbafed343ire_55321"
# I think it's clear?! First there are some static tests, later on random tests too...
#
# Hope you have fun! :-)
