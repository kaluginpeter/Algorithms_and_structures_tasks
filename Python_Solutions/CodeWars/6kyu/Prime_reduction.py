# Consider the prime number 23. If we sum the square of its digits we get: 2^2 + 3^2 = 13,
# then for 13: 1^2 + 3^2 = 10, and finally for 10: 1^2 + 0^2 = 1.
#
# Similarly, if we start with prime number 7, the sequence is: 7->49->97->130->10->1.
#
# Given a range, how many primes within that range will eventually end up being 1?
#
# The upperbound for the range is 50,000. A range of (2,25) means that: 2 <= n < 25.
