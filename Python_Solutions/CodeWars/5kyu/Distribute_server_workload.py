# Bob has a server farm crunching numbers. He has nodes servers in his farm. His company has a lot of work to do.
#
# The work comes as a number workload which indicates how many jobs there are.
# Bob wants his servers to get an equal number of jobs each.
# If that is impossible, he wants the first servers to receive more jobs.
# He also wants the jobs sorted, so that the first server receives the first jobs.
#
# The way this works, Bob wants an array indicating which jobs are going to which servers.
#
# Can you help him distribute all this work as evenly as possible onto his servers?
#
# Example
# Bob has 2 servers and 4 jobs. The first server should receive job 0 and 1 while the second should receive 2 and 3.
#
# distribute(2, 4) # => [[0, 1], [2, 3]]
# On a different occasion Bob has 3 servers and 3 jobs. Each should get just one.
#
# distribute(3, 3) # => [[0], [1], [2]]
# A couple of days go by and Bob sees a spike in jobs. Now there are 10, but he hasn't got
# more than 4 servers available. He boots all of them. This time the first and second should
# get a job more than the third and fourth.
#
# distribute(4, 10) # => [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7], [8, 9]]
# Input
# Don't worry about invalid inputs. That is, nodes > 0 and workload > 0 and both will always be integers.
