# You are given a node that is the beginning of a linked list. This list contains a dangling piece and a loop. Your objective is to determine the length of the loop.
#
# For example in the following picture the size of the dangling piece is 3 and the loop size is 12:
#
#
# # Use the `next' attribute to get the following node
# node.next
# Notes:
#
# do NOT mutate the nodes!
# in some cases there may be only a loop, with no dangling piece
# Thanks to shadchnev, I broke all of the methods from the Hash class.
