# Overview
# An eccentric chessboard maker likes to create strange N x N chessboards.
#
# Instead of making all the rows and the columns on his chessboards the same size,
# he likes to make chessboards with row and columns of varying sizes:
#
# 3
# 1
# 2
# 7
# 1
# 1
# 8
# 4
# 5
# 2
# For example, here are the specifications of his latest 5x5 chessboard:
#
# cs = [ 3, 1, 2, 7, 1 ] contains the 5 widths of the 5 columns.
#
# rs = [ 1, 8, 4, 5, 2 ] contains the 5 heights of the 5 rows.
#
# To be clear, reading the examples of cs and rs above, the width of the 4th column on the chessboard is 7,
# the height of the 2nd row on the chessboard is 8, etc.
#
# Notice, by the way, that since sum(cs) != sum(rs), the total width of the strange chessboard is
# not necessarily the same as the total height.
#
# The chessboard maker now wants to determine how much white and black wood he needs to cover the areas
# in a given chessboard, so is asking you to find the total white area and the total black area on his board.
#
# Important convention
# All his chessboards start with a WHITE CELL IN THE "TOP LEFT", and then alternate black & white in the usual way.
#
# So referring again to cs and rs above, the top left cell on the board is defined by the first column,
# of width = 3, and the first row, of height = 1, so it has an area = 3*1 = 3 and is colored WHITE due
# to the coloring convention.
#
# Now as we move around the board, we can consider for example the cell in the board's column 3 & row 4
# - it has width = 2 and height = 5, for a total area of 2*5 = 10. It is colored BLACK, as determined by
# the alternating chessboard coloring pattern and the starting condition of the top left cell being WHITE.
#
# You may want to draw out a 5x5 board with top left cell colored white to make sure you agree with the above results.
#
# Inputs
# You will be given two lists/arrays, cs and rs, both of size N.
# The widths of all N columns represented in cs, and the heights of all N rows represented in rs,
# will always be integers, and >= 1
# The size of the chessboard, i.e. the value of N, ranges in 1 <= N <= 41000
# PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS: given the very large N board sizes used in some of the random tests,
# as explained in part 3 above, a brute force O(N^2) attempt at solving this kata will timeout...
# Output
# A tuple/struct giving (total_white_area, total_black_area)
#
# Example
# With the values from cs and rs above:
#
# cs = [ 3, 1, 2, 7, 1 ]
#
# rs = [ 1, 8, 4, 5, 2 ]
#
# There are 25 total cells on the chessboard, of which 13 are colored white and 12 are colored black.
#
# Adding up the white cells' areas, you should find that the total_white_area is 146, and adding up
# the black cells' areas that the total_black_area is 134, hence the output is (146, 134).
#
# Note for troubleshooting
# You may want to check that your solution has:
#
# total_area_of_board = total_white_area + total_black_area = total_width * total_height = sum(cs) * sum(rs)
#
# In the example above, note that total_white_area + total_black_area = 146 + 134 = 280,
# which is indeed equal to sum(cs) * sum(rs) = 14 * 20 = 280
