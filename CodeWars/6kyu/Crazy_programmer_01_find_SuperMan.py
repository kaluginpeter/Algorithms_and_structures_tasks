# Crazy programmer : find SuperMan
#
#
# Hey, young man, don't look around, I'm talking to you!
#
# I am a programmer, work in this madhouse. my job is research code, and... at the same time I am also the other researcher's study object. There are a lot of the same people and work with me.
#
# My recent research is how to find Superman, because I found that a SuperMan is hidden inside us, we must find him, then let him go to save the planet.
#
# The conclusion of my research:
# 1. If a person is talking to you, the word 'Superman' appears in
#    the sentence, so he is not a superman.
# 2. Because Superman usually careful to hide the word 'Superman' in
#    a sentence, and each of the two letters are not continuous.
# 3. Sometimes Superman will be especially careful, reverse the word,
#    or transform uppercase and lowercase, let others more difficult
#    to find out.
# Now, I invite you to help me write the code (my hand was injured, there is no way to knock on the keyboard), a function which can correctly find out who is Superman, and let him wear the red pants and cloak, save our earth!
#
# output is a string, if find out SuperMan,
# say "Hi, SuperMan!" to him,  otherwise, say "Are you crazy?"
