# Gellyfish and Flower are playing a game called "Duel".
#
# Gellyfish has a
#  HP, while Flower has b
#  HP.
#
# Each of them has a knight. Gellyfish's knight has c
#  HP, while Flower's knight has d
#  HP.
#
# They will play a game in rounds until one of the players wins. For k=1,2,…
#  in this order, they will perform the following actions:
#
# If k
#  is odd and Gellyfish's knight is alive:
# Gellyfish's knight can attack Flower and reduce b
#  by 1
# . If b≤0
# , Gellyfish wins. Or,
# Gellyfish's knight can attack Flower's knight and reduce d
#  by 1
# . If d≤0
# , Flower's knight dies.
# If k
#  is even and Flower's knight is alive:
# Flower's knight can attack Gellyfish and reduce a
#  by 1
# . If a≤0
# , Flower wins. Or,
# Flower's knight can attack Gellyfish's knight and reduce c
#  by 1
# . If c≤0
# , Gellyfish's knight dies.
# As one of the smartest people in the world, you want to tell them who will win before the game. Assume both players play optimally.
#
# It can be proven that the game will never end in a draw. That is, one player has a strategy to end the game in a finite number of moves.
#
# Input
# Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
#  (1≤t≤104
# ). The description of the test cases follows.
#
# The first and only line of each test case contains four integers a
# , b
# , c
# , d
#  (1≤a,b,c,d≤109
# ) — the HP of Gellyfish, the HP of Flower, the HP of Gellyfish's knight, and the HP of Flower's knight, respectively.
#
# Output
# For each test case, if Flower will win, output "Flower", otherwise output "Gellyfish".

# Flower
# Gellyfish
# Gellyfish
# Note
# In the first test case, Gellyfish has only 1
#  HP. Therefore, no matter what Gellyfish does in the first round, Flower's knight will attack Gellyfish in the second round, allowing Flower to win.
#
# In the second test case, Flower's knight has only 1
#  HP. Gellyfish will attack Flower's knight in the first round. Then Flower's knight will no longer be able to attack, allowing Gellyfish to win.
