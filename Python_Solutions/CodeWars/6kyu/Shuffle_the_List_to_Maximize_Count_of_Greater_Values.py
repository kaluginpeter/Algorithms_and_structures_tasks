# Task
#
# The function is given two lists of equal length a and b. Shuffle the first list a such that the count of a[i] > b[i] for 0 <= i < len(a) is maximized. Return the shuffled list a.
#
# Example 1:
#
# a = [3, 5], b = [4, 2]
# Explanation:
#
# After shuffling a, we want to maximize the count of elements where a[i] > b[i].
# Possible shuffled outputs include [5, 3].
# In [5, 3], we have:
# For i = 0: a[0] = 5 and b[0] = 4, so 5 > 4.
# For i = 1: a[1] = 3 and b[1] = 2, so 3 > 2.
# Thus, both conditions a[0] > b[0] and a[1] > b[1] are satisfied.
# Output:
#
# [5, 3]
# Example 2:
#
# a = [2, 7, 11, 15], b = [1, 10, 4, 11])
# Output:
#
# [2, 11, 7, 15]
# Example 3:
#
# a = [12, 24, 8, 32], b = [13, 25, 32, 11]
# Explanation:
#
# In [24, 32, 8, 12], we have:
# For i = 0: a[0] = 24 and b[0] = 13, so 24 > 13.
# For i = 1: a[1] = 32 and b[1] = 25, so 32 > 25.
# For i = 2: a[2] = 8 and b[2] = 32, so 8 < 32.
# For i = 3: a[3] = 12 and b[3] = 11, so 12 > 11.
# Thus, three conditions a[0] > b[0], a[1] > b[1], and a[3] > b[3] are satisfied.
# Output:
#
# [24, 32, 8, 12]
# Example 4:
#
# a = [2, 2, 5], b = [1, 3, 4]
# Explanation:
#
# In [2, 5, 2], we have:
#
# For i = 0: a[0] = 2 and b[0] = 1, so 2 > 1.
# For i = 1: a[1] = 5 and b[1] = 3, so 5 > 3.
# For i = 2: a[2] = 2 and b[2] = 4, so 2 < 4.
# Thus, two conditions a[0] > b[0] and a[1] > b[1] are satisfied.
#
# Output:
#
# [2, 5, 2]
# Notes
#
# There can be multiple valid solutions to this problem since the order of elements in the shuffled list a can vary.
#
# The helper function in the preloaded section checks the number of elements in a that are greater than the corresponding elements in b to validate the solution.
#
# 1 <= length of lists <= 10^3
