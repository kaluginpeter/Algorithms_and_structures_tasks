# Calculus class...is awesome! But you are a programmer with no time for mindless repetition.
# Your teacher spent a whole day covering differentiation of polynomials, and by the time the bell rang,
# you had already conjured up a program to automate the process.
#
# You realize that a polynomial of degree n
#
# anxn + an-1xn-1 + ... + a0
#
# can be represented as an array of coefficients
#
# [an, an-1, ..., a0]
#
# For example, we would represent
#
# 5x2 + 2x + 1 as [5,2,1]
#
# 3x2 + 1 as [3,0,1]
#
# x4 as [1,0,0,0,0]
#
# x as [1, 0]
#
# 1 as [1]
#
# Your function will take a coefficient array as an argument
# and return a new array representing the coefficients of the derivative.
#
# poly1 = [1, 1] # x + 1
# diff(poly1) == [1] # 1
#
# poly2 = [1, 1, 1] # x^2 + x + 1
# diff(poly2) == [2, 1] # 2x + 1
# diff(diff(poly2)) == [2] # 2
#
# poly3 = [2, 1, 0, 0] # 2x^3 + x^2
# diff(poly3) == [6, 2, 0] # 6x^2 + 2x
# Note: your function will always return a new array which has one
# less element than the argument (unless the argument is [], in which case [] is returned).
