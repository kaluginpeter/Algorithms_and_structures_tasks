/*
Task
Write a function which accepts a sequence of unique integers ( 0 <= x < 32 ) as an argument and returns a 32-bit integer such that the integer, in its binary representation, has 1 at only those indices, numbered from right to left, which are in the sequence.

Examples
[0, 1]  ->  3
[1, 2, 0, 4]  ->   23

Because 23 in binary is

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
                                          . . . . . 5 4 3 2 1 0  <-  indices
                                                      ^   ^ ^ ^
                                                      these bits are 1
          due to the corresponding indices being in the given sequence
FAQ
The function name contains sort because this simulates radix sort.

#include <vector>

int sort_by_bit(const std::vector<int>& array) {
    int output = 0;
    for (int b : array) {
        output |= (1 << b);

    return output;
