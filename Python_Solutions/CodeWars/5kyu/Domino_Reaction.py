# You're given a string of dominos. For each slot, there are 3 options:
#
# "|" represents a standing domino
#
# "/" represents a knocked over domino
#
# " " represents a space where there is no domino
#
# For example:
#
# "||| ||||//| |/"
# Tipping a domino will cause the next domino to its right to fall over as well,
# but if a domino is already tipped over, or there is a domino missing, the reaction will stop.
# What you must do is find the resulting string if the first domino is pushed over.
# So in out example above, the result would be:
#
# "/// ||||//| |/"
# since the reaction would stop as soon as it gets to a space.
