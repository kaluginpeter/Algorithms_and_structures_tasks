# Farmer John has an integer x
# . He creates a sequence of length n
#  by alternating integers x
#  and −x
# , starting with x
# .
#
# For example, if n=5
# , the sequence looks like: x,−x,x,−x,x
# .
#
# He asks you to find the sum of all integers in the sequence.
#
# Input
# The first line contains an integer t
#  (1≤t≤100
# )  — the number of test cases.
#
# The only line of input for each test case is two integers x
#  and n
#  (1≤x,n≤10
# ).
#
# Output
# For each test case, output the sum of all integers in the sequence.
