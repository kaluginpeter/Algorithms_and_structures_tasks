# We know the formula to find the solutions of an equation of second degree with only one variable:

#
# We need the function sec_deg_solver()/secDegSolver(), that accepts three arguments, a, b and c,
# the coefficients of the above equation.
#
# The outputs of the function may vary depending on the values of coefficients a, b and c,
# according to the following situations. (used values as examples only):
#
#
# - If a is equal 0:
#                   - If b and c are not 0. It will return: "It is a
#                     first degree equation. Solution: 0.5512345"
#
#                   - If a, b and c are 0. It will return:
#                      "The equation is indeterminate"
#
#                   - If a and b are 0, and c is not 0. It will
#                      return: "Impossible situation. Wrong entries"
#
#                   - If a and c are 0 and b is not 0: It will return: "It is a first
#                     degree equation. Solution: 0.0"
#
# - If a is not 0:
#                   - If Δ < 0 (see image above). It will return: "There are no real
#                     solutions"
#
#                   - If Δ = 0. It will return: "It has one double solution:
#                     1.4142135624"
#
#                   - If Δ > 0. It will return: "Two solutions: 1,7320508076, 2.0"
#                     (solutions should be sorted)
# The results should be expressed up to 10 decimals rounded result Let's see some cases:
#
#
# a = 0
# b = 2
# c = -4
# sec_deg_solver(a, b, c) == It is a first degree equation. Solution: 2.0
#
# a = 10
# b = 2
# c = -4
# sec_deg_solver(a, b, c) == Two solutions: -0.7403124237, 0.5403124237
#
# a = 1.5
# b = 2
# c = 4
# sec_deg_solver(a, b, c) == There are no real solutions
#
# a = 1
# b = -2
# c = 1
# sec_deg_solver(a, b, c) == It has one double solution: 1.0
#
# a = 0
# b = 0
# c = 0
# sec_deg_solver(a, b, c) == The equation is indeterminate
# (Be aware that the result has a string format and -0.0 is not 0.0)
#
# Note on having two solutions: input them sorted numerically; in the JavaScript version,
# not to put any extra difficulty on this one, sort them with a simple .sort()
# (which will sort them lexicographically).

# Happy coding!!
