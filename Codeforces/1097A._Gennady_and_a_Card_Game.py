# Gennady owns a small hotel in the countryside where he lives a peaceful life. He loves to take long walks, watch sunsets and play cards with tourists staying in his hotel. His favorite game is called "Mau-Mau".
#
# To play Mau-Mau, you need a pack of 52
#  cards. Each card has a suit (Diamonds — D, Clubs — C, Spades — S, or Hearts — H), and a rank (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, K, or A).
#
# At the start of the game, there is one card on the table and you have five cards in your hand. You can play a card from your hand if and only if it has the same rank or the same suit as the card on the table.
#
# In order to check if you'd be a good playing partner, Gennady has prepared a task for you. Given the card on the table and five cards in your hand, check if you can play at least one card.
#
# Input
# The first line of the input contains one string which describes the card on the table. The second line contains five strings which describe the cards in your hand.
#
# Each string is two characters long. The first character denotes the rank and belongs to the set {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,J,Q,K,A}
# . The second character denotes the suit and belongs to the set {D,C,S,H}
# .
#
# All the cards in the input are different.
#
# Output
# If it is possible to play a card from your hand, print one word "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".
#
# You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

# Note
# In the first example, there is an Ace of Spades (AS) on the table. You can play an Ace of Diamonds (AD) because both of them are Aces.
#
# In the second example, you cannot play any card.
#
# In the third example, you can play an Ace of Diamonds (AD) because it has the same suit as a Four of Diamonds (4D), which lies on the table.
