# Write a function that outputs the transpose of a matrix -
# a new matrix where the columns and rows of the original are swapped.
#
# For example, the transpose of:
#
# | 1 2 3 |
# | 4 5 6 |
# is
#
# | 1 4 |
# | 2 5 |
# | 3 6 |
# The input to your function will be an array of matrix rows.
# You can assume that each row has the same length, and that the height and width of the matrix are both positive.
