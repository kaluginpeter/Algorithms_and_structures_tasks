# Task
# Consider a string of lowercase Latin letters and space characters (" ").
#
# First, rearrange the letters in each word alphabetically.
#
# And then rearrange the words in ascending order of the sum of their characters' ASCII values.
#
# If two or more words have the same ASCII value, rearrange them by their length in ascending order; If their length still equals to each other, rearrange them alphabetically.
#
# Finally, return the result.
#
# Example
# For s = "batman is bruce wayne", the result should be "is bceru aenwy aamntb".
#
#   After rearranging the letters the string turns into "aamntb is bceru aenwy". The ASCII values of each word are: [627, 220, 529, 548]. After sorting the words the following string is obtained: "is bceru aenwy aamntb" (with ASCII values of [220, 529, 548, 627]).
#
# For s = "peter parker is spiderman", the result should be "is eeprt aekprr adeimnprs"
#
# (ASCII values: [220, 554, 645, 963])
#
# Input/Output
# [input] string s
# A string of lowercase words. Each word is separated by exactly one space character.
#
# [output] a string
