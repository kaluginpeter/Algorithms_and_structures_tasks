# Your job is to group the words in anagrams.
#
# What is an anagram ?
# star and tsar are anagram of each other because you can rearrange the letters for star to obtain tsar.
#
# Example
# A typical test could be :
#
# // input
# ["tsar", "rat", "tar", "star", "tars", "cheese"]
#
# // output
# [
#   ["tsar", "star", "tars"],
#   ["rat", "tar"],
#   ["cheese"]
# ]
# Hvae unf !
#
# I'd advise you to find an efficient way for grouping the words in anagrams otherwise you'll probably won't pass the heavy superhero test cases
