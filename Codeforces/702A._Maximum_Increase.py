# You are given array consisting of n integers. Your task is to find the maximum length of an increasing subarray of the given array.
#
# A subarray is the sequence of consecutive elements of the array. Subarray is called increasing if each element of this subarray strictly greater than previous.
#
# Input
# The first line contains single positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of integers.
#
# The second line contains n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).
#
# Output
# Print the maximum length of an increasing subarray of the given array.
