# You've just recently been hired to calculate scores for a Dart Board game!
#
# Scoring specifications:
#
# 0 points - radius above 10
# 5 points - radius between 5 and 10 inclusive
# 10 points - radius less than 5
# If all radii are less than 5, award 100 BONUS POINTS!
#
# Write a function that accepts an array of radii (can be integers and/or floats), and returns a total score using the above specification.
#
# An empty array should return 0.
#
# Examples:
# scoreThrows( [1, 5, 11] )    =>  15
# scoreThrows( [15, 20, 30] )  =>  0
# scoreThrows( [1, 2, 3, 4] )  =>  140
