# In this Kata, you will be given a string and two indexes (a and b). Your task is to reverse the portion of that string between those two indices inclusive.
#
# solve("codewars",1,5) = "cawedors" -- elements at index 1 to 5 inclusive are "odewa". So we reverse them.
# solve("cODEWArs", 1,5) = "cAWEDOrs" -- to help visualize.
# Input will be lowercase and uppercase letters only.
#
# The first index a will always be lower that than the string length; the second index b can be greater than the string length. More examples in the test cases. Good luck!
