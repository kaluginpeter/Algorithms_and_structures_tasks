# Suppose a student can earn 100% on an exam by getting the answers all correct or all incorrect. Given a potentially incomplete answer key and the student's answers, write a function that determines whether or not a student can still score 100%. Incomplete questions are marked with an underscore, "_".
#
# ["A", "_", "C", "_", "B"]   # answer key
# ["A", "D", "C", "E", "B"]   # student's solution
#
# ➞ True
#
# # Possible for student to get all questions correct.
#
# ["B", "_", "B"]   # answer key
# ["B", "D", "C"]   # student's solution
#
# ➞ False
#
# # First question is correct but third is wrong, so not possible to score 100%.
#
# ["T", "_", "F", "F", "F"]   # answer key
# ["F", "F", "T", "T", "T"]   # student's solution
#
# ➞ True
#
# # Possible for student to get all questions incorrect.
# Examples
#
# (["B", "A", "_", "_"], ["B", "A", "C", "C"]) ➞ True
#
# (["A", "B", "A", "_"], ["B", "A", "C", "C"]) ➞ True
#
# (["A", "B", "C", "_"], ["B", "A", "C", "C"]) ➞ False
#
# (["B", "_"], ["C", "A"]) ➞ True
#
# (["B", "A"], ["C", "A"]) ➞ False
#
# (["B"], ["B"]) ➞ True
#
# (["_"], ["B"]) ➞ True
# Notes
#
# Test has at least one question.
