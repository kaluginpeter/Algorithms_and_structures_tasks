# You are given a positive integer n.
#
# The task is to calculate how many binary numbers without leading zeros (such that their length is n and they do not contain two zeros in a row) there are. Note that zero itself ("0") meets the conditions (for n = 1).
#
# For example, there are three eligible binary numbers of length 3:
#
# 101
# 110
# 111
# 100 is not suitable.
#
# Remember that n may be fairly big (up to 10^4). Good luck!
