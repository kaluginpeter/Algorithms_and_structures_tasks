# ###Task:
#
# You have to write a function pattern which creates the following pattern (see examples) up to the desired number of rows.
#
# If the Argument is 0 or a Negative Integer then it should return "" i.e. empty string.
#
# If any even number is passed as argument then the pattern should last upto the largest odd number which is smaller than the passed even number.
#
# ###Examples:
#
# pattern(9):
#
# 1
# 333
# 55555
# 7777777
# 999999999
# pattern(6):
#
# 1
# 333
# 55555
# Note: There are no spaces in the pattern
#
# Hint: Use \n in string to jump to next line
