# Context

#
# Your task
# You will be given a string of JSON, consisting of a family tree containing people's names, genders and children. Your task will be to find the seventh sons of seventh sons in the family tree, and return a set of their names. If there are none, return an empty set.
#
# Tips
# Have a good look at the sample test cases.
#
# For a seventh son to be a seventh son, there must not be any daughters in the line leading to him. There may be daughters after him, though.
#
# Use print_tree preloaded function to print the family tree in a compact human-readable form
