# Given a fixed-length integer array arr, duplicate each occurrence of zero,
# shifting the remaiing elements to the right.
# Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written.
# Do the above modifications to the input array in place and do not return anything.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
# Output: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
# Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
# Example 2:
#
# Input: arr = [1,2,3]
# Output: [1,2,3]
# Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= arr.length <= 104
# 0 <= arr[i] <= 9
# Solution
