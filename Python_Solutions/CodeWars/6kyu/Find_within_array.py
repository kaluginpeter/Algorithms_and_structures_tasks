# We'll create a function that takes in two parameters:
#
# a sequence (length and types of items are irrelevant)
# a function (value, index) that will be called on members of the sequence and their index.
# The function will return either true or false.
# Your function will iterate through the members of the sequence in order until the provided
# function returns true; at which point your function will return that item's index.
#
# If the function given returns false for all members of the sequence, your function should return -1.
#
# true_if_even = lambda value, index: value % 2 == 0
# find_in_array([1,3,5,6,7], true_if_even) # --> 3
