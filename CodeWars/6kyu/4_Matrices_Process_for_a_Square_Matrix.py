# Given a certain square matrix A, of dimension n x n, that has negative and positive values (many of them may be 0).
#
# We need the following values rounded to the closest integer:
#
# the average of all the positive numbers and zeros that are in the principal diagonal and in the columns with odd index, avg1
#
# the absolute value of the average of all the negative numbers in the secondary diagonal and in the columns with even index, avg2
#
# Let's see the requirements in an example:
#
# A = [[ 1,   3, -4,   5, -2,  5,  1],
#     [  2,   0, -7,   6,  8,  8, 15],
#     [  4,   4, -2, -10,  7, -1,  7],
#     [ -1,   3,  1,   0, 11,  4, 21],
#     [ -7,   6, -4,  10,  5,  7,  6],
#     [ -5,   4,  3,  -5,  7,  8, 17],
#     [-11,   3,  4,  -8,  6, 16,  4]]
# The elements of the principal diagonal are:
#
# [1, 0, -2, 0, 5, 8, 4]
# The ones that are also in the "odd columns" (we consider the index starting with 0) are:
#
# [0, 0, 8] all positives
# So,
#
# avg1 =  [8 / 3] = 3
# The elements of the secondary diagonal are:
#
# [-11, 4, -4, 0, 7, 8, 1]
# The ones that are in the even columns are:
#
# [-11, -4, 7, 1]
# The negative ones are:
#
# [-11, -4]
# So,
#
# avg2 = [|-15 / 2|] = 8
# Create a function that may receive a square matrix of uncertain dimensions and may output both averages in an array in the following order: [avg1, avg2]
#
# If one of the diagonals have no elements fulfilling the requirements described above the function should return -1 So, if the function processes the matrix given above, it should output:
#
# [3, 8]
# Features of the random tests:
#
# number of tests = 110
# 5 ≤ matrix_length ≤ 1000
# -1000000 ≤ matrix[i, j] ≤ 1000000
# Enjoy it! Translations into another languages will be released soon.
