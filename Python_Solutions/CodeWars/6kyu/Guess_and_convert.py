# In this kata, you have to define a function named func that will take a list as input.
#
# You must try and guess the pattern how we get the output number and return list - [output number,binary representation,octal representation,hexadecimal representation], but you must convert that specific number without built-in : bin,oct and hex functions.
#
# Examples :
#
# func([12,13,6,3,6,45,123]) returns - [29,'11101','35','1d']
#
# func([1,9,23,43,65,31,63,99]) returns - [41,'101001','51','29']
#
# func([2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,19]) returns - [10,'1010','12','a']
