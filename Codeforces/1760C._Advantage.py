# There are n
#  participants in a competition, participant i
#  having a strength of si
# .
#
# Every participant wonders how much of an advantage they have over the other best participant. In other words, each participant i
#  wants to know the difference between si
#  and sj
# , where j
#  is the strongest participant in the competition, not counting i
#  (a difference can be negative).
#
# So, they ask you for your help! For each i
#  (1≤i≤n
# ) output the difference between si
#  and the maximum strength of any participant other than participant i
# .
#
# Input
# The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
#  (1≤t≤1000
# ) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.
#
# The first line of each test case contains an integer n
#  (2≤n≤2⋅105
# ) — the length of the array.
#
# The following line contains n
#  space-separated positive integers s1
# , s2
# , ..., sn
#  (1≤si≤109
# ) — the strengths of the participants.
#
# It is guaranteed that the sum of n
#  over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
# .
#
# Output
# For each test case, output n
#  space-separated integers. For each i
#  (1≤i≤n
# ) output the difference between si
#  and the maximum strength of any other participant.

# Note
# For the first test case:
#
# The first participant has a strength of 4
#  and the largest strength of a participant different from the first one is 7
# , so the answer for the first participant is 4−7=−3
# .
# The second participant has a strength of 7
#  and the largest strength of a participant different from the second one is 5
# , so the answer for the second participant is 7−5=2
# .
# The third participant has a strength of 3
#  and the largest strength of a participant different from the third one is 7
# , so the answer for the third participant is 3−7=−4
# .
# The fourth participant has a strength of 5
#  and the largest strength of a participant different from the fourth one is 7
# , so the answer for the fourth participant is 5−7=−2
