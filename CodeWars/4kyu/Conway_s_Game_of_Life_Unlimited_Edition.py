# Given a 2D array and a number of generations, compute n timesteps of Conway's Game of Life.
#
# The rules of the game are:
#
# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
# Each cell's neighborhood is the 8 cells immediately around it (i.e. Moore Neighborhood). The universe is infinite in both the x and y dimensions and all cells are initially dead - except for those specified in the arguments. The return value should be a 2d array cropped around all of the living cells. (If there are no living cells, then return [[]].)
#
# For illustration purposes, 0 and 1 will be represented as ░░ and ▓▓ blocks respectively (PHP: plain black and white squares). You can take advantage of the htmlize function to get a text representation of the universe, e.g.:
#
# print(htmlize(cells))
