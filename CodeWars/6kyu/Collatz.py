# Preface
# A collatz sequence, starting with a positive integern,
# is found by repeatedly applying the following function to n until n == 1 :
# f(n)={
# n/2, if n is even
# 3n+1, if n is odd
# â€‹
#
#
# A more detailed description of the collatz conjecture may be found on Wikipedia.
#
# The Problem
# Create a function collatz that returns a collatz sequence string
# starting with the positive integer argument passed into the function, in the following form:
#
# "X0->X1->...->XN"
#
# Where Xi is each iteration of the sequence and N is the length of the sequence.
#
# Sample Input
# Input: 4
# Output: "4->2->1"
#
# Input: 3
# Output: "3->10->5->16->8->4->2->1"
# Don't worry about invalid input. Arguments passed into the function are guaranteed to be valid integers >= 1.

def collatz(n):
    w = ''
    w += str(n)
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n/2
            w += '->' + str(int(n))
        else:
            n = 3*n + 1
            w += '->' + str(int(n))
    return w
