# Introduction to Disjunctions
# In logic and mathematics, a disjunction is an operation on 2 or more propositions. A disjunction is true if and only if 1 or more of its operands is true. In programming, we typically denote a disjunction using "||", but in logic we typically use "v".
#
# Example of disjunction:
#
# p = 1 > 2 = false
# q = 2 < 3 = true
# therefore p v q is true
# In a programming language, we might write this as:
#
# var p = 1 > 2;        // false
# var q = 2 < 3;        // true
# var result = p || q;  // true
# The above example demonstrates an inclusive disjunction (meaning it includes cases where both operands are true). Disjunctions can also be exlusive. An exclusive disjunction is typically represented by "⊻" and is true if and only if both operands have opposite values.
#
# p = 1 < 2 = true
# q = 2 < 3 = true
# therefore p ⊻ q is false
# This can become confusing when dealing with more than 2 operands.
#
# r = 3 < 4 = true
# p ⊻ q ⊻ r = ???
# We handle these situations by evaluating the expression from left to right.
#
# p ⊻ q = false
# (p ⊻ q) ⊻ r = true
# Directions:
# For this kata, your task is to implement a function that performs a disjunction operation on 2 or more propositions.
#
# Should take a boolean array as its first parameter and a single boolean as its second parameter, which, if true, should indicate that the disjunction should be exclusive as opposed to inclusive.
# Should return true or false.
