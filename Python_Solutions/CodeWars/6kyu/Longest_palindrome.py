# A palindrome is a series of characters that read the same forwards
# as backwards such as "hannah", "racecar" and "lol".
#
# For this Kata you need to write a function that takes a string of
# characters and returns the length, as an integer value, of longest
# alphanumeric palindrome that could be made by combining the characters
# in any order but using each character only once. The function should not be case sensitive.
#
# For example if passed "Hannah" it should return 6 and if passed "aabbcc_yYx_"
# it should return 9 because one possible palindrome would be "abcyxycba".
