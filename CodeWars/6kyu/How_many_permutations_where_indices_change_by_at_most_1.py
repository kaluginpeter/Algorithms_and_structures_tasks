# Overview
# We are going to be studying permutations of n distinct elements - for simplicity we shall use the integers from 1 to n.
#
# If we start with the integers 1 to n in ascending order in a list:
#
# [1, 2, 3, ..., n-2, n-1, n]
#
# then, for a given value of n, how many permutations of this list are there in which each element's index changes by AT MOST 1 after the permutation?
#
# Inputs
# You will be given an integer, n, representing the number of distinct elements that we want to permute.
#
# As mentioned, for definiteness, you can think of the integers from 1 to n in a starting list given by [1, 2, ..., n]
#
# Performance requirement: Values from 0 up to 200 may be tested.
#
# Output
# You must return an integer representing the total number of possible permutations of the list [1, 2, ..., n] that satisfy the requirement.
#
# Important notes
# The identity permutation, where no element changes its index, is a valid permutation according to the definition, so make sure you include it in your total.
# You cannot wrap-around the list, so changing element 1 with element n is not allowed (except for the case n = 2 of course).
# Walk-through Example
# Let's consider the case n = 4; so concretely we are looking at permutations of the list [1,2,3,4]
#
# There are in total n! = 4! = 24 possible permutations of this list.
#
# If you write out all of these 24 possible permutations, you will find that only 5 satisfy the above requirement:
#
# [1,2,3,4] - no element changes index.
#
# [2,1,3,4] - elements 1&2 change indices by +1 and -1 respectively.
#
# [1,3,2,4] - elements 2&3 change indices by +1 and -1 respectively.
#
# [1,2,4,3] - elements 3&4 change indices by +1 and -1 respectively.
#
# [2,1,4,3] - elements 1&2 change indices by +1 and -1 respectively and elements 3&4 change indices by +1 and -1 respectively.
#
# In all of the 5 above permutations, the elements' indices have indeed changed by at most 1.
#
# So for the input n = 4 you should return the answer 5.
#
# Explanation of an INVALID permutation for n = 4
#
# To be clear, let's consider another permutation which does not satisfy the kata's requirement, and therefore should not be included in your total:
#
# [3,4,2,1] - element 1 has changed index by +3, element 2 by +1, element 3 by -2, element 4 by -2.
#
# The above permutation is therefore not allowed, since at least one element has changed index by more than 1.
