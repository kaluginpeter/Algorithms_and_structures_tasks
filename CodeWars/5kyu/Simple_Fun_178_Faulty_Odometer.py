# Task
# You are given a car odometer which displays the miles traveled as an integer.
#
# The odometer has a defect, however: it proceeds from digit 3 to digit 5 always skipping the digit 4. This defect shows up in all positions (ones, tens, hundreds, etc).
#
# For example, if the odometer displays 15339 and the car travels another mile, the odometer changes to 15350 (instead of 15340).
#
# Your task is to calculate the real distance, according The number the odometer shows.
#
# Example
# For n = 13 the output should be 12(4 skipped).
#
# For n = 15 the output should be 13(4 and 14 skipped).
#
# For n = 2003 the output should be 1461.
#
# Input/Output
# [input] integer n
# The number the odometer shows.
#
# 1 <= n <= 999999999
#
# [output] an integer
# The real distance.
