# Alice and Bob received n
#  candies from their parents. Each candy weighs either 1 gram or 2 grams. Now they want to divide all candies among themselves fairly so that the total weight of Alice's candies is equal to the total weight of Bob's candies.
#
# Check if they can do that.
#
# Note that candies are not allowed to be cut in half.
#
# Input
# The first line contains one integer t
#  (1≤t≤104
# ) — the number of test cases. Then t
#  test cases follow.
#
# The first line of each test case contains an integer n
#  (1≤n≤100
# ) — the number of candies that Alice and Bob received.
#
# The next line contains n
#  integers a1,a2,…,an
#  — the weights of the candies. The weight of each candy is either 1
#  or 2
# .
#
# It is guaranteed that the sum of n
#  over all test cases does not exceed 105
# .
#
# Output
# For each test case, output on a separate line:
#
# "YES", if all candies can be divided into two sets with the same weight;
# "NO" otherwise.
# You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).

# Note
# In the first test case, Alice and Bob can each take one candy, then both will have a total weight of 1
# .
#
# In the second test case, any division will be unfair.
#
# In the third test case, both Alice and Bob can take two candies, one of weight 1
#  and one of weight 2
# .
#
# In the fourth test case, it is impossible to divide three identical candies between two people.
#
# In the fifth test case, any division will also be unfair.
