# You've been collecting change all day, and it's starting to pile up in your pocket, but you're too lazy to see how much you've found.
#
# Good thing you can code!
#
# Create change_count() to return a dollar amount of how much change you have!
#
# Valid types of change include:
#
# penny: 0.01
# nickel: 0.05
# dime: 0.10
# quarter: 0.25
# dollar: 1.00
# These amounts are already preloaded as floats into the CHANGE dictionary for you to use!
#
# You should return the total in the format $x.xx.
#
# Examples:
#
# change_count('nickel penny dime dollar') == '$1.16'
# change_count('dollar dollar quarter dime dime') == '$2.45'
# change_count('penny') == '$0.01'
# change_count('dime') == '$0.10'
# Warning, some change may amount to over $10.00!
