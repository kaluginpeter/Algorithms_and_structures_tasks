# You are given two integers red and blue representing the count of red and blue colored balls. You have to arrange these balls to form a triangle such that the 1st row will have 1 ball, the 2nd row will have 2 balls, the 3rd row will have 3 balls, and so on.
#
# All the balls in a particular row should be the same color, and adjacent rows should have different colors.
#
# Return the maximum height of the triangle that can be achieved.
