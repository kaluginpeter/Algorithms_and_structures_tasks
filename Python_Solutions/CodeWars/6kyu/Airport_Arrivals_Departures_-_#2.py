# Well here you are again, still staring blankly at the same arrivals/departures flap display...
#
# Kata Task
# Part #1
# In Part #1 of this series you already figured out how the flap display mechanism works.
#
# You now know what the updated display will look like after applying a set of rotor moves.
#
# If you haven't already completed Part 1, then now is a good time to do it!
#
# Part #2
# Now in this current Kata your task is the opposite.
#
# It's the same board with the same rules...
#
# But this time you are required to return the set of rotor moves needed to
# transform the display from the before to the after state.
#
# Look at the example tests for guidance.
#
# And good luck!
#
