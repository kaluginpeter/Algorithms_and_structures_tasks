# Task
# You have two sorted arrays a and b, merge them to form new array of unique items.
#
# If an item is present in both arrays, it should be part of the resulting array if and only if
# it appears in both arrays the same number of times.
#
# Example
# For a = [1, 3, 40, 40, 50, 60, 60, 60] and b = [2, 40, 40, 50, 50, 65], the result should be [1, 2, 3, 40, 60, 65].
#
#  Number 40 appears 2 times in both arrays,  thus it is in the resulting array.
#  Number 50 appears once in array a and twice in array b,  therefore it is not part of the resulting array.
#
# Input/Output
# [input] integer array a
# A sorted array.
#
# 1 ≤ a.length ≤ 500000
#
# [input] integer array b
# A sorted array.
#
# 1 ≤ b.length ≤ 500000
#
# [output] an integer array
#
# The resulting sorted array.

# Solution
def merge_arrays(a, b):
    return sorted([i for i in set(a+b) if a.count(i)==b.count(i) or a.count(i)*b.count(i)==0])
