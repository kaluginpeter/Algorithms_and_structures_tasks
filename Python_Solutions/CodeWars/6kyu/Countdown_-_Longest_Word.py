# #Detail
#
# Countdown is a British game show with number and word puzzles. The letters round consists
# of the contestant picking 9 shuffled letters - either picking from the vowel pile or the consonant pile.
# The contestants are given 30 seconds to try to come up with the longest English word they can think of
# with the available letters - letters can not be used more than once unless there is another of the same character.
#
# #Task
#
# Given an uppercase 9 letter string, letters, find the longest word that can be made with some or all
# of the letters. The preloaded array words (or $words in Ruby) contains a bunch of uppercase words that
# you will have to loop through. Only return the longest word; if there is more than one, return the words
# of the same lengths in alphabetical order. If there are no words that can be made from the letters given,
# return None/nil/null.
#
# ##Examples
#
# letters = "ZZZZZZZZZ"
# longest word = None
#
# letters = "POVMERKIA",
# longest word = ["VAMPIRE"]
#
# letters = "DVAVPALEM"
# longest word = ["VAMPED", "VALVED", "PALMED"]
