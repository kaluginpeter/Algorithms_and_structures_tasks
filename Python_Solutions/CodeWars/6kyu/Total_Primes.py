# The number 23 is special in the sense that all of its digits are prime numbers. Furthermore, it's a prime itself. There are 4 such numbers between 10 and 100: 23, 37, 53, 73. Let's call these numbers "total primes".
#
# Complete the function that takes a range (a, b) and returns the number of total primes within that range (a <= primes < b). The test ranges go up to 107.
#
# Examples
# (10, 100)  ==> 4  # 23, 37, 53, 73
# (500, 600) ==> 3  # 523, 557, 577
# Happy coding!
