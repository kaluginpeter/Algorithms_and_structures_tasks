# Oh no! I've lost my glasses, but paradoxically, I need glasses to find my glasses!
#
# Please help me out by showing me the index in the list which contains my glasses. They look like two capital Os, with at least one dash in between!
#
# This means that both O--O and O------------O are valid glasses, but not O----#--O for example!
# Search thoroughly, you might find my glasses in places such as 'dustO-Odust'
# Examples
# ["phone", "O-O", "coins", "keys"] ➞ 1
#
# ["OO", "wallet", "O##O", "O----O"] ➞ 3
#
# ["O--#--O", "dustO---Odust", "more dust"] ➞ 1
# Notes
# All lists will include one valid pair of glasses because I swear I dropped them around here somewhere ...
# All elements in the list are strings.
