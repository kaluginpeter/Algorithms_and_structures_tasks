# Write
#
# remove(text, what)
# that takes in a string str(text in Python) and an object/hash/dict/Dictionary what and returns a string with the chars removed in what. For example:
#
# remove('this is a string',{'t':1, 'i':2}) == 'hs s a string'
# # remove from 'this is a string' the first 1 't' and the first 2 i's.
# remove('hello world',{'x':5, 'i':2}) == 'hello world'
# # there are no x's or i's, so nothing gets removed
# remove('apples and bananas',{'a':50, 'n':1}) == 'pples d bnns'
# # we don't have 50 a's, so just remove it till we hit end of string.
