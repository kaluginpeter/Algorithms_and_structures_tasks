# In this exercise, you will create a function that takes an integer, i. With it you must do the following:
#
# Find all of its multiples up to and including 100,
#
# Then take the digit sum of each multiple (eg. 45 -> 4 + 5 = 9),
#
# And finally, get the total sum of each new digit sum.
#
# Note: If the digit sum of a number is more than 9 (eg. 99 -> 9 + 9 = 18) then you do NOT have to break it down further until it reaches one digit.
#
# Example (if i is 25):
#
# Multiples of 25 up to 100 --> [25, 50, 75, 100]
#
# Digit sum of each multiple --> [7, 5, 12, 1]
#
# Sum of each new digit sum --> 25
#
# If you can, try writing it in readable code.
