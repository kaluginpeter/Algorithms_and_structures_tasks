# There are two sisters Alice and Betty. You have n
#  candies. You want to distribute these n
#  candies between two sisters in such a way that:
#
# Alice will get a
#  (a>0
# ) candies;
# Betty will get b
#  (b>0
# ) candies;
# each sister will get some integer number of candies;
# Alice will get a greater amount of candies than Betty (i.e. a>b
# );
# all the candies will be given to one of two sisters (i.e. a+b=n
# ).
# Your task is to calculate the number of ways to distribute exactly n
#  candies between sisters in a way described above. Candies are indistinguishable.
#
# Formally, find the number of ways to represent n
#  as the sum of n=a+b
# , where a
#  and b
#  are positive integers and a>b
# .
#
# You have to answer t
#  independent test cases.
#
# Input
# The first line of the input contains one integer t
#  (1≤t≤104
# ) — the number of test cases. Then t
#  test cases follow.
#
# The only line of a test case contains one integer n
#  (1≤n≤2⋅109
# ) — the number of candies you have.
#
# Output
# For each test case, print the answer — the number of ways to distribute exactly n
#  candies between two sisters in a way described in the problem statement. If there is no way to satisfy all the conditions, print 0
# .
