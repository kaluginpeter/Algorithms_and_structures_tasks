# Complete the solution so that it returns the number of times the search_text is found within the full_text. Overlap is not permitted : "aaa" contains 1 instance of "aa", not 2.
#
# Usage example:
#
# full_text = "aa_bb_cc_dd_bb_e", search_text = "bb"
#     ---> should return 2 since "bb" shows up twice
#
#
# full_text = "aaabbbcccc", search_text = "bbb"
#     ---> should return 1
