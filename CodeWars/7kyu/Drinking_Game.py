# Mike and Joe are fratboys that love beer and games that involve drinking. They play the following game: Mike chugs one beer, then Joe chugs 2 beers, then Mike chugs 3 beers, then Joe chugs 4 beers, and so on. Once someone can't drink what he is supposed to drink, he loses.
#
# Mike can chug at most A beers in total (otherwise he would pass out), while Joe can chug at most B beers in total. Who will win the game?
#
# Write the function game(A,B) that returns the winner, "Mike" or "Joe" accordingly, for any given integer values of A and B.
#
# Note: If either Mike or Joe cannot drink at least 1 beer, return the string "Non-drinkers can't play".
