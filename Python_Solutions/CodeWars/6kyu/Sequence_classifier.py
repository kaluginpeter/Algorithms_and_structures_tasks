# A series or sequence of numbers is usually the product of a function and can either be infinite or finite.
#
# In this kata we will only consider finite series and you are required to return a code according to the type of sequence:
#
# Code	Type	Example
# 0	unordered	[3,5,8,1,14,3]
# 1	strictly increasing	[3,5,8,9,14,23]
# 2	not decreasing	[3,5,8,8,14,14]
# 3	strictly decreasing	[14,9,8,5,3,1]
# 4	not increasing	[14,14,8,8,5,3]
# 5	constant	[8,8,8,8,8,8]
# You can expect all the inputs to be non-empty and completely numerical arrays/lists - no need to validate the data; do not go for sloppy code, as rather large inputs might be tested.
#
# Try to achieve a good solution that runs in linear time; also, do it functionally, meaning you need to build a pure function or, in even poorer words, do NOT modify the initial input!
