# Two strings a and b are called isomorphic if there is a one to one mapping possible for every character
# of a to every character of b. And all occurrences of every character in a map to same character in b.
#
# Task
# In this kata you will create a function that return True if two given strings are isomorphic to each other,
# and False otherwise. Remember that order is important.
#
# Your solution must be able to handle words with more than 10 characters.
#
# Example
# True:
#
# CBAABC DEFFED
# XXX YYY
# RAMBUNCTIOUSLY THERMODYNAMICS
# False:
#
# AB CC
