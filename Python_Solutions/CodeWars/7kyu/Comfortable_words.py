# A comfortable word is a word which you can type always alternating the hand you type with (assuming you type using a QWERTY keyboard and use fingers as shown in the image below).
#
# That being said, complete the function which receives a word and returns true if it's a comfortable word and false otherwise.
#
# The word will always be a string consisting of only ascii letters from a to z.
#
#
#
# To avoid problems with image availability, here's the lists of letters for each hand:
#
# Left: q, w, e, r, t, a, s, d, f, g, z, x, c, v, b
# Right: y, u, i, o, p, h, j, k, l, n, m
# Examples
# "yams"  -->  true
# "test"  -->  false
