# There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:
#
# number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
# distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
# width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
# Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).
#

# Solution
def pillars(num_pill, dist, width):
    return (num_pill - 2) * width + (100 * dist) * (num_pill - 1) if num_pill > 1 else 0
