# Compute the complex logarithm at any given complex number, accurate to at least 1 in 10^-12. The imaginary part should be inside the interval (−π, π] (i.e if the imaginary part is exactly π, keep it as is).
#
# Note: You shouldn't try to compute the value of this function at the poles. Please return null/NULL/nil/None (C#: throw an ArgumentException, Java: throw an ArithmeticException) if this happens.
