# In this Kata, we are going to determine if the count of each of the characters in a string can be equal if we remove a single character from that string.
#
# For example:
#
# solve('abba') = false -- if we remove any character, the count of each character will not be equal.
# solve('abbba') = true -- if we remove one b, the count of each character becomes 2.
# solve('aaaa') = true -- if we remove one character, the remaining characters have same count.
# solve('wwwf') = true -- if we remove f, the remaining letters have same count.
# More examples in the test cases. Empty string is not tested.
#
# Good luck!
