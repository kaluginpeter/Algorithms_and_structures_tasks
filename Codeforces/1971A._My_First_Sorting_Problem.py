# A. My First Sorting Problem
# time limit per test1 second
# memory limit per test256 megabytes
# You are given two integers x
#  and y
# .
#
# Output two integers: the minimum of x
#  and y
# , followed by the maximum of x
#  and y
# .
#
# Input
# The first line contains a single integer t
#  (1≤t≤100
# ) — the number of test cases.
#
# The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x
#  and y
#  (0≤x,y≤9
# ).
#
# Output
# For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x
#  and y
# , followed by the maximum of x
#  and y
# .
