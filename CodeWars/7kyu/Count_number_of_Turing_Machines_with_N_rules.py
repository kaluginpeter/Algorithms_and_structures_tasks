# A Turing Machine is a mathematical model of computation describing an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model's simplicity, it is capable of implementing any computer algorithm.
#
# All the rule table tells us is: for each state: if the bit at the current position of the head is a 0 then we take some action. But if the bit at the current position of the head is a 1 then we take a different action.
#
# An action is either HALT or a 3-part tuple: [write 0 or 1, move Left or Right, go to state 1..N]
#
# Here's an example of a program with just one state:
#
# const states = {
#   "A": [
#     [1, "left", "A"],
#     [0, "right", "A"]
#   ]
# }
# Example of a 3-state rule table (in pseudo-code, this time):
#
# State 1:
#   0 -> (1, L, 2)
#   1 -> (0, R, 2)
# State 2:
#   0 -> (1, L, 3)
#   1 -> (0, R, 3)
# State 3:
#   0 -> HALT
#   1 -> (0, R, 1)
# Task
# Implement countRuleTables(n) to return the number of unique rule-tables as an int.
#
# Input
# n â€” the number of states in the Turing Machine. Each state must define actions for both 0 and 1.
#
# lower bound (inclusive): 1
#
# upper bound (exclusive): 250 (may change based on feedback while kata is in beta)
#
# Example
# Here are all possible ways to create a Turing rule-table with a single state.
#
# CLICK TO OPEN
# There are 25 unique rule tables. So countRuleTables(1) is 25.
#
# Enjoy!
#
# p.s. This kata description goes deeper into explaining how to use Turing Machines than it needs to. I just thought a bit of background could motivate what would seem to be an arbitrary math problem. In addition, it was mentioned in the discourse that HALT is typically considered a separate state. But this kata does not consider it as separate. Just FYI.
