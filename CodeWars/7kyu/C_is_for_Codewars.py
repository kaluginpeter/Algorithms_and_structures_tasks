# Task:
# Build a string representing a capital letter C of a given size out of 'C' characters.
#
# Examples:
# generate_C(1) should return this string:
#
# CCCCC
# C
# C
# C
# CCCCC
#
# generate_C(2) should be
#
# CCCCCCCCCC
# CCCCCCCCCC
# CC
# CC
# CC
# CC
# CC
# CC
# CCCCCCCCCC
# CCCCCCCCCC
#
# and so on. The string returned by generate_C(size) should have 5*size lines, following the format above. size is a positive integer â‰¤ 2000.
#
# Note that extra spaces after the C's in any line are incorrect. And the last line should not terminate with "\n".
#
# This kata was inspired by A for Apple, but takes a different approach to generating letters.
