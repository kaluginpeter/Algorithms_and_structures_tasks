# Given a possibly empty list of strictly positive numbers and a non-negative target number, return either a subset of the list summing to the target, or null or a similar empty value if no such subset exists.
#
# The subset must consist of unique ( by index ) list elements.
# If a particular value occurs more than once in the input list, you can use it up to as many times as it occurs.
# The empty subset sums to 0.
# If multiple valid subsets exist, return any one of them.
#
# The target will never be much bigger than the sum of the input list, and often quite a bit smaller.
