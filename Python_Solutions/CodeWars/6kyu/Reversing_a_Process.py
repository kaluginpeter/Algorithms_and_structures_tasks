# Suppose we know the process by which a string s was encoded to a string r
# (see explanation below). The aim of the kata is to decode this string r to get back the original string s.
#
# Explanation of the encoding process:
# input: a string s composed of lowercase letters from "a" to "z", and a positive integer num
# we know there is a correspondence between abcde...uvwxyzand 0, 1, 2 ..., 23, 24, 25 : 0 <-> a, 1 <-> b ...
# if c is a character of s whose corresponding number is x, apply to x the
# function f: x-> f(x) = num * x % 26, then find ch the corresponding character of f(x)
# Accumulate all these ch in a string r
# concatenate num and r and return the result
# For example:
#
# encode("mer", 6015)  -->  "6015ekx"
#
# m --> 12,   12 * 6015 % 26 = 4,    4  --> e
# e --> 4,     4 * 6015 % 26 = 10,   10 --> k
# r --> 17,   17 * 6015 % 26 = 23,   23 --> x
#
# So we get "ekx", hence the output is "6015ekx"
# Task
# A string s was encoded to string r by the above process. complete the function to get back s whenever it is possible.
#
# Indeed it can happen that the decoding is impossible for strings composed
# of whatever letters from "a" to "z" when positive integer num has not been correctly chosen.
# In that case return "Impossible to decode".
#
# Examples
# decode "6015ekx" -> "mer"
# decode "5057aan" -> "Impossible to decode"
