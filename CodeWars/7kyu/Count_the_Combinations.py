# Consider a sequence of integers xs, and a target integer n. Your task is to write a function which counts how many combinations of indexes of xs meet two rules:
#
# The size of the combination must be 1 less than the size of xs
# The sum of elements corresponding to the indexes must equal n
# For example:
#
# xs = [5, 0, 0, 2], n = 7
#
# All combinations of indexes (of size 3)
# {0, 1, 2} -> 5 + 0 + 0 = 5
# {0, 1, 3} -> 5 + 0 + 2 = 7
# {0, 2, 3} -> 5 + 0 + 2 = 7
# {1, 2, 3} -> 0 + 0 + 2 = 2
#
# Only 2 combinations match the target -> Answer = 2
