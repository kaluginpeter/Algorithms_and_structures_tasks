# The integer 64 is the first integer that has all of its digits even and furthermore, is a perfect square.
#
# The second one is 400 and the third one 484.
#
# Give the numbers of this sequence that are in the range [a,b] (both values inclusive)
#
# Examples:
#
# Even digit squares between 100 to 1000:  [400, 484]  (the output should be sorted)
# Even digit squares between 1000 to 4000: []
# Features of the random tests:
#
# number of tests = 167
# maximum value for a = 1e10
# maximum value for b = 1e12
# You do not have to check the entries; a and b are always positive integers and a < b.

# Happy coding!!
