# Build Tower
# Build a pyramid-shaped tower, as an array/list of strings, given a positive integer number of floors.
# A tower block is represented with "*" character.
#
# For example, a tower with 3 floors looks like this:
#
# [
#   "  *  ",
#   " *** ",
#   "*****"
# ]
# And a tower with 6 floors looks like this:
#
# [
#   "     *     ",
#   "    ***    ",
#   "   *****   ",
#   "  *******  ",
#   " ********* ",
#   "***********"
# ]
# Go challenge Build Tower Advanced once you have finished this :)
