# Create a function, that accepts an arbitrary number of arrays and returns a single array generated by alternately appending elements from the passed in arguments. If one of them is shorter than the others, the result should be padded with empty elements.
#
# Examples:
#
# interleave([1, 2, 3], ["c", "d", "e"]) == [1, "c", 2, "d", 3, "e"]
# interleave([1, 2, 3], [4, 5]) == [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, None]
# interleave([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]) == [1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 8, 3, 6, 9]
# interleave([]) == []
