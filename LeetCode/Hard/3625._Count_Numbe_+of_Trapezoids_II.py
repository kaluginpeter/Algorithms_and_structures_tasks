# You are given a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinates of the ith point on the Cartesian plane.
#
# Return the number of unique trapezoids that can be formed by choosing any four distinct points from points.
#
# A trapezoid is a convex quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides. Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: points = [[-3,2],[3,0],[2,3],[3,2],[2,-3]]
#
# Output: 2
#
# Explanation:
#
#
#
# There are two distinct ways to pick four points that form a trapezoid:
#
# The points [-3,2], [2,3], [3,2], [2,-3] form one trapezoid.
# The points [2,3], [3,2], [3,0], [2,-3] form another trapezoid.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: points = [[0,0],[1,0],[0,1],[2,1]]
#
# Output: 1
#
# Explanation:
#
#
#
# There is only one trapezoid which can be formed.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 4 <= points.length <= 500
# –1000 <= xi, yi <= 1000
# All points are pairwise distinct.
